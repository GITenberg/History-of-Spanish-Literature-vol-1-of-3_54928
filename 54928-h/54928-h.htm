  <h2 class="nobreak g2">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="lh150"><span class="smcap">In</span> the year eighteen
hundred and eighteen I travelled through a large part of Spain, and
spent several months in Madrid. My object was to increase a very
imperfect knowledge of the language and literature of the country,
and to purchase Spanish books, always so rare in the great book-marts
of the rest of Europe. In some respects, the time of my visit was
favorable to the purposes for which I made it; in others, it was not.
Such books as I wanted were then, it is true, less valued in Spain than
they are now, but it was chiefly because the country was in a depressed
and unnatural state; and, if its men of letters were more than commonly
at leisure to gratify the curiosity of a stranger, their number had
been materially diminished by political persecution, and intercourse
with them was difficult because they had so little connection with each
other, and were so much shut out from the world around them.</p>

<p class="lh150">It was, in fact, one of the darkest periods of
the reign of Ferdinand the Seventh, when the desponding seemed to
think that the eclipse was not only total,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span> but “beyond all hope of day.” The absolute
power of the monarch had been as yet nowhere publicly questioned; and
his government, which had revived the Inquisition and was not wanting
in its spirit, had, from the first, silenced the press, and, wherever
its influence extended, now threatened the extinction of all generous
culture. Hardly four years had elapsed since the old order of things
had been restored at Madrid, and already most of the leading men of
letters, whose home was naturally in the capital, were in prison or
in exile. Melendez Valdes, the first Spanish poet of the age, had
just died in misery on the unfriendly soil of France. Quintana, in
many respects the heir to his honors, was confined in the fortress of
Pamplona. Martinez de la Rosa, who has since been one of the leaders of
the nation as well as of its literature, was shut up in Peñon on the
coast of Barbary. Moratin was languishing in Paris, while his comedies
were applauded to the very echo by his enemies at home. The Duke de
Rivas, who, like the old nobles of the proudest days of the monarchy,
has distinguished himself alike in arms, in letters, and in the civil
government and foreign diplomacy of his country, was living retired
on the estates of his great house in Andalusia. Others of less mark
and note shared a fate as rigorous; and, if Clemencin, Navarrete, and
Marina were permitted still to linger in the capital from which their
friends had been driven, their footsteps were watched and their lives
were unquiet.</p>

<p class="lh150"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[p.
vii]</span>Among the men of letters whom I earliest knew in Madrid
was Don José Antonio Conde, a retired, gentle, modest scholar, rarely
occupied with events of a later date than the times of the Spanish
Arabs, whose history he afterwards illustrated. But, far as his
character and studies removed him from political turbulence, he had
already tasted the bitterness of a political exile; and now, in the
honorable poverty to which he had been reduced, he not unwillingly
consented to pass several hours of each day with me, and direct my
studies in the literature of his country. In this I was very fortunate.
We read together the early Castilian poetry, of which he knew more
than he did of the most recent, and to which his thoughts and tastes
were much nearer akin. He assisted me, too, in collecting the books I
needed;—never an easy task where bookselling, in the sense elsewhere
given to the word, was unknown, and where the Inquisition and the
confessional had often made what was most desirable most rare. But Don
José knew the lurking-places where such books and their owners were to
be sought; and to him I am indebted for the foundation of a collection
in Spanish literature, which, without help like his, I should have
failed to make. I owe him, therefore, much; and, though the grave has
long since closed over my friend and his persecutors, it is still a
pleasure to me to acknowledge obligations which I have never ceased to
feel.</p>

<p class="lh150">Many circumstances, since the period of my visit
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[p. viii]</span> Spain, have
favored my successive attempts to increase the Spanish library I then
began. The residence in Madrid of my friend, the late Mr. Alexander
Hill Everett, who ably represented his country for several years at
the court of Spain; and the subsequent residence there, in the same
high position, of my friend, Mr. Washington Irving, equally honored
on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially cherished by Spaniards
for the enduring monument he has erected to the history of their early
adventures, and for the charming fictions, whose scene he has laid in
their romantic country;—these fortunate circumstances naturally opened
to me whatever facilities for collecting books could be afforded by the
kindness of persons in places so distinguished, or by their desire to
spread among their countrymen at home a literature they knew so well
and loved so much.</p>

<p class="lh150">But to two other persons, not unconnected with these
statesmen and men of letters, it is no less my duty and my pleasure to
make known my obligations. The first of them is Mr. O. Rich, formerly
a Consul of the United States in Spain; the same bibliographer to whom
Mr. Irving and Mr. Prescott have avowed similar obligations, and to
whose personal regard I owe hardly less than I do to his extraordinary
knowledge of rare and curious books, and his extraordinary success
in collecting them. The other is Don Pascual de Gayangos, Professor
of Arabic in the University of Madrid,—certainly in his peculiar
department among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[p. ix]</span>
the most eminent scholars now living, and one to whose familiarity
with whatever regards the literature of his own country, the frequent
references in my notes bear a testimony not to be mistaken. With the
former of these gentlemen I have been in constant communication for
many years, and have received from him valuable contributions of books
and manuscripts collected in Spain, England, and France for my library.
With the latter, to whom I am not less largely indebted, I first became
personally acquainted when I passed in Europe the period between 1835
and 1838, seeking to know scholars such as he is, and consulting,
not only the principal public libraries of the Continent, but such
rich private collections as those of Lord Holland in England, of M.
Ternaux-Compans in France, and of the venerated and much-loved Tieck in
Germany; all of which were made accessible to me by the frank kindness
of their owners.</p>

<p class="lh150">The natural result of such a long-continued interest
in Spanish literature, and of so many pleasant inducements to study
it, has been—I speak in a spirit of extenuation and self-defence—<i>a
book</i>. In the interval between my two residences in Europe I delivered
lectures upon its principal topics to successive classes in Harvard
College; and, on my return home from the second, I endeavoured to
arrange these lectures for publication. But when I had already
employed much labor and time on them, I found—or thought I found—that
the tone of discussion which I had adopted for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_x">[p. x]</span> my academical audiences was not suited to
the purposes of a regular history. Destroying, therefore, what I had
written, I began afresh my never unwelcome task, and so have prepared
the present work, as little connected with all I had previously done as
it, perhaps, can be, and yet cover so much of the same ground.</p>

<p class="lh150">In correcting my manuscript for the press I have
enjoyed the counsels of two of my more intimate friends; of Mr. Francis
C. Gray, a scholar who should permit the world to profit more than it
does by the large resources of his accurate and tasteful learning, and
of Mr. William H. Prescott, the historian of both hemispheres, whose
name will not be forgotten in either, but whose honors will always be
dearest to those who have best known the discouragements under which
they have been won, and the modesty and gentleness with which they are
worn. To these faithful friends, whose unchanging regard has entered
into the happiness of all the active years of my life, I make my
affectionate acknowledgments, as I now part from a work in which they
have always taken an interest, and which, wherever it goes, will carry
on its pages the silent proofs of their kindness and taste.</p>

<p class="lh150 mt2">I cannot dismiss the last sheet of this History,
without offering my sincere thanks to the conductors of the University
Press at Cambridge, and to Mr. George<span class="pagenum"

practised skill and conscientious fidelity with which, after it was in

  Trouble.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the earliest ages of every
literature that has vindicated for itself a permanent character in
modern Europe, much of what constituted its foundations was the
result of local situation and of circumstances seemingly accidental.
Sometimes, as in Provence, where the climate was mild and the soil
luxuriant, a premature refinement started forth, which was suddenly
blighted by the influences of the surrounding barbarism. Sometimes,
as in Lombardy and in a few portions of France, the institutions of
antiquity were so long preserved by the old municipalities, that,
in occasional intervals of peace, it seemed as if the ancient forms
of civilization might be revived and prevail;—hopes kindled only
to be extinguished by the violence amidst which the first modern
communities, with the policy they needed, were brought forth and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> established. And sometimes
both these causes were combined with others, and gave promise of
a poetry full of freshness and originality, which, however, as it
advanced, was met by a spirit more vigorous than its own, beneath whose
predominance its language was forbidden to rise above the condition
of a local dialect, or became merged in that of its more fortunate
rival;—a result which we early recognize alike in Sicily, Naples, and
Venice, where the authority of the great Tuscan masters was, from the
first, as loyally acknowledged as it was in Florence or Pisa.</p>

<p>Like much of the rest of Europe, the southwestern portion, now
comprising the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, was affected by nearly
all these different influences. Favored by a happy climate and soil, by
the remains of Roman culture, which had lingered long in its mountains,
and by the earnest and passionate spirit which has marked its people
through their many revolutions down to the present day, the first
signs of a revived poetical feeling are perceptible in the Spanish
peninsula even before they are to be found, with their distinctive
characteristics, in that of Italy. But this earliest literature of
modern Spain, a part of which is Provençal and the rest absolutely
Castilian or Spanish, appeared in troubled times, when it was all but
impossible that it should be advanced freely or rapidly in the forms
it was destined at last to wear. For the masses of the Christian
Spaniards filling the separate states, into which their country was
most unhappily divided, were then involved in that tremendous warfare
with their Arab invaders, which, for twenty generations, so consumed
their strength, that, long before the cross was planted on the towers
of the Alhambra, and peace had given opportunity<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> for the ornaments of life, Dante, Petrarca,
and Boccaccio had appeared in the comparative quiet of Lombardy and
Tuscany, and Italy had again taken her accustomed place at the head of
the elegant literature of the world.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, a large portion of the Spaniards, who had
been so long engaged in this solemn contest, as the forlorn hope of
Christendom, against the intrusion of Mohammedanism<a id="FNanchor_1"
href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and its imperfect
civilization into Europe, and who, amidst all their sufferings, had
constantly looked to Rome, as to the capital seat of their faith, for
consolation and encouragement, did not hesitate again to acknowledge
the Italian supremacy in letters,—a supremacy to which, in the days
of the Empire, their allegiance had been complete. A school formed on
Italian models naturally followed; and though the rich and original
genius of Spanish poetry received less from its influence ultimately
than might have been anticipated, still, from the time of its
first appearance, its effects are too important and distinct to be
overlooked.</p>

<p>Of the period, therefore, in which the history of Spanish literature
opens upon us, we must make two divisions. The first will contain
the genuinely national poetry and prose produced from the earliest
times down to the reign of Charles the Fifth; while the second will
contain that portion which, by imitating the refinement of Provence
or of Italy, was, during the same interval, more or less separated
from the popular spirit and genius. Both, when taken together, will
fill up the period in which the main elements and characteristics of
Spanish literature were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span>
developed, such as they have existed down to our own age.</p>


<p class="mt2">In the first division of the first period, we are to
consider the origin and character of that literature which sprang, as
it were, from the very soil of Spain, and was almost entirely untouched
by foreign influences.</p>

<p>And here, at the outset, we are struck with a remarkable
circumstance, which announces something at least of the genius of the
coming literature,—the circumstance of its appearance in times of
great confusion and violence. For, in other portions of Europe, during
those disastrous troubles that accompanied the overthrow of the Roman
power and civilization, and the establishment of new forms of social
order, if the inspirations of poetry came at all, they came in some
fortunate period of comparative quietness and security, when the minds
of men were less engrossed than they were wont to be by the necessity
of providing for their personal safety and for their most pressing
physical wants. But in Spain it was not so. There, the first utterance
of that popular feeling which became the foundation of the national
literature was heard in the midst of the extraordinary contest which
the Christian Spaniards, for above seven centuries, urged against
their Moorish invaders; so that the earliest Spanish poetry seems but
a breathing of the energy and heroism which, at the time it appeared,
animated the great mass of the Spanish Christians throughout the
Peninsula.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we look at the condition of Spain, in the centuries
that preceded and followed the formation of its present language and
poetry, we shall find the mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p.
7]</span> historical dates full of instruction. In 711, Roderic
rashly hazarded the fate of his Gothic and Christian empire on the
result of a single battle against the Arabs, then just forcing their
way into the western part of Europe from Africa. He failed; and the
wild enthusiasm which marked the earliest age of the Mohammedan power
achieved almost immediately the conquest of the whole of the country
that was worth the price of a victory. The Christians, however, though
overwhelmed, did not entirely yield. On the contrary, many of them
retreated before the fiery pursuit of their enemies, and established
themselves in the extreme northwestern portion of their native land,
amidst the mountains and fastnesses of Biscay and Asturias. There,
indeed, the purity of the Latin tongue, which they had spoken for so
many ages, was finally lost, through that neglect of its cultivation
which was a necessary consequence of the miseries that oppressed them.
But still, with the spirit which so long sustained their forefathers
against the power of Rome, and which has carried their descendants
through a hardly less fierce contest against the power of France, they
maintained, to a remarkable degree, their ancient manners and feelings,
their religion, their laws, and their institutions; and, separating
themselves by an implacable hatred from their Moorish invaders, they
there, in those rude mountains, laid deep the foundations of a national
character,—of that character which has subsisted to our own times.<a
id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span></p>

<p>As, however, they gradually grew inured to adversity, and understood
the few hard advantages which their situation afforded them, they
began to make incursions into the territories of their conquerors,
and to seize for themselves some part of the fair possessions, once
entirely their own. But every inch of ground was defended by the same
fervid valor by which it had originally been won. The Christians,
indeed, though occasionally defeated, generally gained something by
each of their more considerable struggles; but what they gained could
be preserved only by an exertion of bravery and military power hardly
less painful than that by which it had been acquired. In 801, we find
them already possessing a considerable part of Old Castile; but the
very name now given to that country, from the multitude of castles
with which it was studded, shows plainly the tenure by which the
Christians from the mountains were compelled to hold these early fruits
of their courage and constancy.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A century later, or in 914, they had pushed
the outposts of their conquests to the chain of the Guadarrama,
separating New from Old Castile, and they may, therefore, at this date,
be regarded as having again obtained a firm foothold in their own
country, whose capital they established at Leon.</p>

<p>From this period, the Christians seem to have felt assured of final
success. In 1085, Toledo, the venerated head of the old monarchy, was
wrested from the Moors, who had then possessed it three hundred and
sixty-three years; and in 1118, Saragossa was recovered: so that, from
the beginning of the twelfth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p.
9]</span> century, the whole Peninsula, down to the Sierra of Toledo,
was again occupied by its former masters; and the Moors were pushed
back into the southern and western provinces, by which they had
originally entered. Their power, however, though thus reduced within
limits comprising scarcely more than one third of its extent when
it was greatest, seems still to have been rather consolidated than
broken; and after three centuries of success, more than three other
centuries of conflict were necessary before the fall of Granada finally
emancipated the entire country from the loathed dominion of its
misbelieving conquerors.</p>

<p>But it was in the midst of this desolating contest, and at a period,
too, when the Christians were hardly less distracted by divisions
among themselves than worn out and exasperated by the common warfare
against the common enemy, that the elements of the Spanish language
and poetry, as they have substantially existed ever since, were first
developed. For it is precisely between the capture of Saragossa,
which insured to the Christians the possession of all the eastern
part of Spain, and their great victory on the plains of Tolosa,
which so broke the power of the Moors, that they never afterwards
recovered the full measure of their former strength,<a id="FNanchor_4"
href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>—it is precisely in this
century of confusion and violence, when the Chris<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>tian population of the country may be
said, with the old chronicle, to have been kept constantly in battle
array, that we hear the first notes of their wild, national poetry,
which come to us mingled with their war-shouts, and breathing the
very spirit of their victories.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> oldest document in the Spanish

Seventh, in the year 1155, of a charter of regulations and privileges
granted to the city of Avilés in Asturias.<a id="FNanchor_6"
href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is important, not only
because it exhibits the new dialect just emerging from the corrupted
Latin, little or not at all affected by the Arabic infused into it in
the southern provinces, but because it is believed to be among the very
oldest documents ever written in Spanish, since there is no good reason
to suppose that language to have existed in a written form even half a
century earlier.</p>

<p>How far we can go back towards the first appearance of poetry in
this Spanish, or, as it was oftener called, Castilian, dialect is not
so precisely ascertained; but we know that we can trace Castilian verse
to a period surprisingly near the date of the document of Avilés.
It is, too, a remarkable circumstance, that we can thus trace it by
works both long and interesting; for, though ballads, and the other
forms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span> popular
poetry, by which we mark indistinctly the beginning of almost every
other literature, are abundant in the Spanish, we are not obliged to
resort to them, at the outset of our inquiries, since other obvious and
decisive monuments present themselves at once.</p>


<p class="mt2">The first of these monuments in age, and the first in
importance, is the poem commonly called, with primitive simplicity
and directness, “The Poem of the Cid.” It consists of above three
thousand lines, and can hardly have been composed later than the
year 1200. Its subject, as its name implies, is taken from among
the adventures of the Cid, the great popular hero of the chivalrous
age of Spain; and the whole tone of its manners and feelings is in
sympathy with the contest between the Moors and the Christians, in
which the Cid bore so great a part, and which was still going on with
undiminished violence at the period when the poem was written. It has,
therefore, a national bearing and a national character throughout.<a
id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span></p>

<p>The Cid himself, who is to be found constantly commemorated in
Spanish poetry, was born in the northwestern part of Spain, about the
year 1040, and died in 1099, at Valencia, which he had rescued from the
Moors.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
His original name was Ruy Diaz,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p.
14]</span> or Rodrigo Diaz; and he was by birth one of the considerable
barons of his country. The title of <i>Cid</i>, by which he is almost
always known, is believed to have come to him from the remarkable
circumstance, that five Moorish kings or chiefs acknowledged him
in one battle as their <i>Seid</i>, or their lord and conqueror;<a
id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
the title of <i>Campeador</i>, or Champion, by which he is hardly less
known, though it is commonly supposed to have been given to him as a
leader of the armies of Sancho the Second, has long since been used
almost exclusively as a popular expression of the admiration of his
countrymen for his exploits against the Moors.<a id="FNanchor_10"
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> At any rate, from a
very early period, he has been called <i>El Cid Campeador</i>, or The Lord
Champion. And he well deserved the honorable title; for he passed
almost the whole of his life in the field against the oppressors of his
country, suffering, so far as we know, scarcely a single defeat from
the common enemy, though, on more than one occasion, he was exiled and
sacrificed by the Christian princes to whose interests he had attached
himself.</p>

<p>But, whatever may have been the real adventures of his life, over
which the peculiar darkness of the period when they were achieved
has cast a deep shadow,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he comes to us in modern times as the great
defender of his nation against its Moorish invaders, and seems to
have so filled the imagination and satisfied the affections of his
countrymen, that, centuries after his death, and even down to our own
days, poetry and tradition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p.
15]</span> have delighted to attach to his name a long series of
fabulous achievements, which connect him with the mythological fictions
of the Middle Ages, and remind us almost as often of Amadis and Arthur
as they do of the sober heroes of genuine history.<a id="FNanchor_12"
href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The Poem of the Cid partakes of both these characters. It has
sometimes been regarded as wholly, or almost wholly, historical.<a
id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But
there is too free and romantic a spirit in it for history. It contains,
indeed, few of the bolder fictions found in the subsequent chronicles
and in the popular ballads. Still, it is essentially a poem; and in
the spirited scenes at the siege of Alcocer and at the Cortes, as well
as in those relating to the Counts of Carrion, it is plain that the
author felt his license as a poet. In fact, the very marriage of the
daughters of the Cid has been shown to be all but impossible; and thus
any real historical foundation seems to be taken away from the chief
event which the poem records.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This, however, does not at<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> all touch the proper value
of the work, which is simple, heroic, and national. Unfortunately,
the only ancient manuscript of it known to exist is imperfect, and
nowhere informs us who was its author. But what has been lost is not
much. It is only a few leaves in the beginning, one leaf in the middle,
and some scattered lines in other parts. The conclusion is perfect.
Of course, there can be no doubt about the subject or purpose of the
whole. It is the development of the character and glory of the Cid, as
shown in his achievements in the kingdoms of Saragossa and Valencia,
in his triumph over his unworthy sons-in-law, the Counts of Carrion,
and their disgrace before the king and Cortes, and, finally, in the
second marriage of his two daughters with the Infantes of Navarre
and Aragon; the whole ending with a slight allusion to the hero’s
death, and a notice of the date of the manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_15"
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>But the story of the poem constitutes the least of its claims to
our notice. In truth, we do not read it at all for its mere facts,
which are often detailed with the minuteness and formality of a monkish
chronicle; but for its living pictures of the age it represents, and
for the vivacity with which it brings up manners and interests so
remote from our own experience, that, where<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> they are attempted in formal history, they
come to us as cold as the fables of mythology. We read it because it
is a contemporary and spirited exhibition of the chivalrous times
of Spain, given occasionally with an Homeric simplicity altogether
admirable. For the story it tells is not only that of the most
romantic achievements, attributed to the most romantic hero of Spanish
tradition, but it is mingled continually with domestic and personal
details, that bring the character of the Cid and his age near to our
own sympathies and interests.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The very language in which it is told is the
language he himself spoke, still only half developed; disencumbering
itself with difficulty from the characteristics of the Latin; its new
constructions by no means established; imperfect in its forms, and ill
furnished with the connecting particles in which resides so much of
the power and grace of all languages; but still breathing the bold,
sincere, and original spirit of its times, and showing plainly that it
is struggling with success for a place among the other wild elements
of the national genius. And, finally, the metre and rhyme into which
the whole poem is cast are rude and unsettled: the verse claiming to
be of fourteen syllables, divided by an abrupt cæsural pause after the
eighth, yet often running out to sixteen or twenty, and sometimes<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span> falling back to twelve;<a
id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but
always bearing the impress of a free and fearless spirit, which
harmonizes alike with the poet’s language, subject, and age, and so
gives to the story a stir and interest, which, though we are separated
from it by so many centuries, bring some of its scenes before us like
those of a drama.</p>

<p>The first pages of the manuscript being lost, what remains to
us begins abruptly, at the moment when the Cid, just exiled by his
ungrateful king, looks back upon the towers of his castle at Bivar, as
he leaves them. “Thus heavily weeping,” the poem goes on, “he turned
his head and stood looking at them. He saw his doors open and his
household chests unfastened, the hooks empty and without pelisses and
without cloaks, and the mews without falcons and without hawks. My Cid
sighed, for he had grievous sorrow; but my Cid spake well and calmly:
‘I thank thee, Lord and Father, who art in heaven, that it is my evil
enemies who have done this thing unto me.’”</p>

<p>He goes, where all desperate men then went, to the frontiers of
the Christian war; and, after establishing his wife and children in a
religious house, plunges with three hundred faithful followers into
the infidel territories, determined, according to the practice of his
time, to win lands and fortunes from the common enemy, and providing
for himself meanwhile, according to another practice of his time, by
plundering the Jews as if he were a mere Robin Hood. Among his earliest
conquests is Alcocer; but the Moors collect in force, and besiege
him in their turn, so that he can save himself<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> only by a bold sally, in which he
overthrows their whole array. The rescue of his standard, endangered in
the onslaught by the rashness of Bermuez, who bore it, is described in
the very spirit of knighthood.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Their shields before their breasts, · forth at once they go,</p>
<p class="i0">Their lances in the rest, · levelled fair and low,</p>
<p class="i0">Their banners and their crests · waving in a row,</p>
<p class="i0">Their heads all stooping down · toward the saddle-bow;</p>
<p class="i0">The Cid was in the midst, · his shout was heard afar,</p>
<p class="i0">“I am Ruy Diaz, · the champion of Bivar;</p>
<p class="i0">Strike amongst them, Gentlemen, · for sweet mercies’ sake!”</p>
<p class="i0">There where Bermuez fought · amidst the foe they brake,</p>
<p class="i0">Three hundred bannered knights, · it was a gallant show.</p>
<p class="i0">Three hundred Moors they killed, · a man with every blow;</p>
<p class="i0">When they wheeled and turned, · as many more lay slain;</p>
<p class="i0">You might see them raise their lances · and level them again.</p>
<p class="i0">There you might see the breast-plates · how they were cleft in twain,</p>
<p class="i0">And many a Moorish shield · lie shattered on the plain,</p>
<p class="i0">The pennons that were white · marked with a crimson stain,</p>
<p class="i0">The horses running wild · whose riders had been slain.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span>The poem
afterwards relates the Cid’s contest with the Count of Barcelona; the
taking of Valencia; the reconcilement of the Cid to the king, who had
treated him so ill; and the marriage of the Cid’s two daughters, at the
king’s request, to the two Counts of Carrion, who were among the first
nobles of the kingdom. At this point, however, there is a somewhat
formal division of the poem,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and the remainder is devoted to what is its
principal subject, the dissolution of this marriage in consequence of
the baseness and brutality of the Counts; the Cid’s public triumph
over them; their no less public disgrace; and the announcement of the
second marriage of the Cid’s daughters with the Infantes of Navarre and
Aragon, which, of course, raised the Cid himself to the highest pitch
of his honors, by connecting him with the royal houses of Spain. With
this, therefore, the poem virtually ends.</p>

<p>The most spirited part of it consists of the scenes at the Cortes,
summoned, on demand of the Cid, in consequence of the misconduct of the
Counts of Carrion. In one of them, three followers of the Cid challenge
three followers of the Counts, and the challenge of Munio Gustioz to
Assur Gonzalez is thus characteristically given:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Assur Gonzalez · was entering at the door,</p>
<p class="i0">With his ermine mantle · trailing along the floor;</p>
<p class="i0">With his sauntering pace · and his hardy look,</p>
<p class="i0">Of manners or of courtesy · little heed he took;</p>
<p class="i0">He was flushed and hot · with breakfast and with drink.</p>
<p class="i0">“What ho! my masters, · your spirits seem to sink!</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span>Have we no news stirring from the Cid, · Ruy Diaz of Bivar?</p>
<p class="i0">Has he been to Riodivirna, · to besiege the windmills there?</p>
<p class="i0">Does he tax the millers for their toll? · or is that practice past?</p>
<p class="i0">Will he make a match for his daughters, · another like the last?”</p>
<p class="i2">Munio Gustioz · rose and made reply:—</p>
<p class="i0">“Traitor, wilt thou never cease · to slander and to lie?</p>
<p class="i0">You breakfast before mass, · you drink before you pray;</p>
<p class="i0">There is no honor in your heart, · nor truth in what you say;</p>
<p class="i0">You cheat your comrade and your lord, · you flatter to betray;</p>
<p class="i0">Your hatred I despise, · your friendship I defy!</p>
<p class="i0">False to all mankind, · and most to God on high,</p>
<p class="i0">I shall force you to confess · that what I say is true.”</p>
<p class="i0">Thus was ended the parley · and challenge betwixt these two.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>The opening of the lists for the six combatants, in the presence of
the king, is another passage of much spirit and effect.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The heralds and the king · are foremost in the place.</p>
<p class="i0">They clear away the people · from the middle space;</p>
<p class="i0">They measure out the lists, · the barriers they fix,</p>
<p class="i0">They point them out in order · and explain to all the six:</p>
<p class="i0">“If you are forced beyond the line · where they are fixed and traced,</p>
<p class="i0">You shall be held as conquered · and beaten and disgraced.”</p>
<p class="i0">Six lances’ length on either side · an open space is laid;</p>
<p class="i0">They share the field between them, · the sunshine and the shade.</p>
<p class="i0">Their office is performed, · and from the middle space</p>
<p class="i0">The heralds are withdrawn · and leave them face to face.</p>
<p class="i0">Here stood the warriors of the Cid, · that noble champion;</p>
<p class="i0">Opposite, on the other side, · the lords of Carrion.</p>
<p class="i0">Earnestly their minds are fixed · each upon his foe.</p>
<p class="i0">Face to face they take their place, · anon the trumpets blow;</p>
<p class="i0">They stir their horses with the spur, · they lay their lances low,</p>
<p class="i0">They bend their shields before their breasts, · their face to the saddle-bow.</p>
<p class="i0">Earnestly their minds are fixed · each upon his foe.</p>
<p class="i0">The heavens are overcast above, · the earth trembles below;</p>
<p class="i0">The people stand in silence, · gazing on the show.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span>These are among
the most picturesque passages in the poem. But it is throughout
striking and original. It is, too, no less national, Christian, and
loyal. It breathes everywhere the true Castilian spirit, such as the
old chronicles represent it amidst the achievements and disasters of
the Moorish wars; and has very few traces of an Arabic influence in
its language, and none at all in its imagery or fancies. The whole of
it, therefore, deserves to be read, and to be read in the original;
for it is there only that we can obtain the fresh impressions it is
fitted to give us of the rude but heroic period it represents: of the
simplicity of the governments, and the loyalty and true-heartedness of
the people; of the wide force of a primitive religious enthusiasm; of
the picturesque state of manners and daily life in an age of trouble
and confusion; and of the bold outlines of the national genius, which
are often struck out where we should least think to find them. It
is, indeed, a work which, as we read it, stirs us with the spirit
of the times it describes; and as we lay it down and recollect the
intellectual condition of Europe when it was written, and for a long
period before, it seems certain, that, during the thousand years
which elapsed from the time of the decay of Greek and Roman culture,
down to the appearance of the “Divina Commedia,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span>” no poetry was produced so original in its
tone, or so full of natural feeling, picturesqueness, and energy.<a
id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span></p>

<p>Three other poems, anonymous like that of the Cid, have been placed
immediately after it, because they are found together in a single
manuscript assigned to the thirteenth century, and because the language
and style of at least the first of them seem to justify the conjecture
that carries it so far back.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The poem with which this manuscript opens is called “The Book
of Apollonius,” and is the reproduction of a story whose origin is
obscure, but which is itself familiar to us in the eighth book of
Gower’s “Confessio Amantis,” and in the play of “Pericles,” that has
sometimes been attributed to Shakspeare. It is found in Greek rhyme
very early, but is here taken, almost without alteration of incident,
from that great repository of popular fiction in the Middle Ages, the
“Gesta Romanorum.” It consists of about twenty-six hundred lines,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span> divided into stanzas of
four verses, all terminating with the same rhyme. At the beginning, the
author says, in his own person,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">In God’s name the most holy · and Saint Mary’s name most dear,</p>
<p class="i0">If they but guide and keep me · in their blessed love and fear,</p>
<p class="i0">I will strive to write a tale, · in mastery new and clear,</p>
<p class="i0">Where of royal Apollonius · the courtly you shall hear.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The new mastery or method—<i>nueva maestría</i>—here claimed may be
the structure of the stanza and its rhyme; for, in other respects,
the versification is like that of the Poem of the Cid; showing,
however, more skill and exactness in the mere measure, and a slight
improvement in the language. But the merit of the poem is small. It
contains occasional notices of the manners of the age when it was
produced,—among the rest, some sketches of a female <i>jongleur</i>, of the
class soon afterwards severely denounced in the laws of Alfonso the
Wise,—that are curious and interesting. Its chief attraction, however,
is its story, and this, unhappily, is not original.<a id="FNanchor_25"
href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The next poem in the collection is called “The Life of our Lady,
Saint Mary of Egypt,”—a saint formerly much more famous than she is
now, and one whose history is so coarse and indecent, that it has often
been rejected by the wiser members of the church that canonized her.
Such as it appears in the old traditions, however, with all its sins
upon its head, it is here set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p.
26]</span> forth. But we notice at once a considerable difference
between the composition of its verse and that of any Castilian poetry
assigned to the same or an earlier period. It is written in short
lines, generally of eight syllables, and in couplets; but sometimes
a single line carelessly runs out to the number of ten or eleven
syllables; and, in a few instances, three or even four lines are
included in one rhyme. It has a light air, quite unlike the stateliness
of the Poem of the Cid, and seems, from its verse and tone, as well as
from a few French words scattered through it, to have been borrowed
from some of the earlier French Fabliaux, or, at any rate, to have been
written in imitation of their easy and garrulous style. It opens thus,
showing that it was intended for recitation:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Listen, ye lordlings, listen to me,</p>
<p class="i0">For true is my tale, as true can be;</p>
<p class="i0">And listen in heart, that so ye may</p>
<p class="i0">Have pardon, when humbly to God ye pray.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It consists of fourteen hundred such meagre, monkish verses, and
is hardly of importance, except as a monument of the language at the
period when it was written.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The last of the three poems is in the same irregular measure and
manner. It is called “The Adoration of the Three Holy Kings,” and
begins with the old tradition about the wise men that came from
the East; but its chief subject is an arrest of the Holy Family,
during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span> their flight
to Egypt, by robbers, the child of one of whom is cured of a hideous
leprosy by being bathed in water previously used for bathing the
Saviour; this same child afterwards turning out to be the penitent
thief of the crucifixion. It is a rhymed legend of only two hundred
and fifty lines, and belongs to the large class of such compositions
that were long popular in Western Europe.<a id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">Thus far, the poetry of the first century of Spanish
literature, like the earliest poetry of other modern countries, is
anonymous; for authorship was a distinction rarely coveted or thought
of by those who wrote in any of the dialects then forming throughout
Europe, among the common people. It is even impossible to tell from
what part of the Christian conquests in Spain the poems of which we
have spoken have come to us. We may infer, indeed, from their language
and tone, that the Poem of the Cid belongs to the border country of the
Moorish war in the direction of Catalonia and Valencia, and that the
earliest ballads, of which we shall speak hereafter, came originally
from the midst of the contest, with whose very spirit they are often
imbued. In the same way, too, we may be persuaded that the poems of
a more religious temper were produced in the quieter kingdoms of the
North, where monasteries had been founded and Christianity had already
struck its roots deeply into the soil of the national character. Still,
we have no evidence to show where any one of the poems we have thus far
noticed was written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>But as we advance,
this state of things is changed. The next poetry we meet is by a known
author, and, comes from a known locality. It was written by Gonzalo,
a secular priest who belonged to the monastery of San Millan or Saint
Emilianus, in the territory of Calahorra, far within the borders of
the Moorish war, and who is commonly called Berceo, from the place
of his birth. Of the poet himself we know little, except that he
flourished from 1220 to 1246, and that, as he once speaks of suffering
from the weariness of old age,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> he probably died after 1260, in the
reign of Alfonso the Wise.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>His works amount to above thirteen thousand lines, and
fill an octavo volume.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> They are all on religious subjects, and
consist of rhymed Lives of San Domingo de Silos, Santa Oria, and San
Millan; poems on the Mass, the Martyrdom of San Lorenzo, the Merits of
the Madonna, the Signs that are to precede the Last Judgment, and the
Mourning of the Madonna at the Cross, with a few Hymns, and especially
a poem of more than three thousand six hundred lines on the Miracles
of the Virgin Mary. With one inconsiderable exception, the whole of
this formidable mass of verse is divided into stanzas of four lines
each, like those in the poem of Apollonius of Tyre; and though in the
language there is a perceptible advance since the days when the Poem of
the Cid was written, still the power and movement<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span> of that remarkable legend are entirely
wanting in the verses of the careful ecclesiastic.<a id="FNanchor_31"
href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span>“The Life of
San Domingo de Silos,” with which his volume opens, begins, like a
homily, with these words: “In the name of the Father, who made all
things, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, son of the glorious Virgin, and
of the Holy Spirit, who is equal with them, I intend to tell a story
of a holy confessor. I intend to tell a story in the plain Romance,
in which the common man is wont to talk to his neighbour; for I am
not so learned as to use the other Latin. It will be well worth, as
I think, a cup of good wine.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Of course, there is no poetry in thoughts
like these; and much of what Berceo has left us does not rise
higher.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, we find better things. In some portions of
his work, there is a simple-hearted piety that is very attractive, and
in some, a story-telling spirit that is occasionally picturesque. The
best passages are to be found in his long poem on the “Miracles of
the Virgin,” which consists of a series of twenty-five tales of her
intervention in human affairs, composed evidently for the purpose of
increasing the spirit of devotion in the worship particularly paid to
her. The opening or induction to these tales contains, perhaps, the
most poetical passage in Berceo’s works; and in the following version
the measure and system of rhyme in the original have been preserved, so
as to give something of its air and manner:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">My friends, and faithful vassals · of Almighty God above,</p>
<p class="i0">If ye listen to my words · in a spirit to improve,</p>
<p class="i0">A tale ye shall hear · of piety and love,</p>
<p class="i0">Which afterwards yourselves · shall heartily approve.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">I, a master in Divinity, · Gonzalve Berceo hight,</p>
<p class="i0">Once wandering as a Pilgrim, · found a meadow richly dight,</p>
<p class="i0">Green and peopled full of flowers, · of flowers fair and bright,</p>
<p class="i0">A place where a weary man · would rest him with delight.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And the flowers I beheld · all looked and smelt so sweet,</p>
<p class="i0">That the senses and the soul · they seemed alike to greet;</p>
<p class="i0">While on every side ran fountains · through all this glad retreat,</p>
<p class="i0">Which in winter kindly warmth supplied, · yet tempered summer’s heat.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And of rich and goodly trees · there grew a boundless maze,</p>
<p class="i0">Granada’s apples bright, · and figs of golden rays,</p>
<p class="i0">And many other fruits, · beyond my skill to praise;</p>
<p class="i0">But none that turneth sour, · and none that e’er decays.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">The freshness of that meadow, · the sweetness of its flowers,</p>
<p class="i0">The dewy shadows of the trees, · that fell like cooling showers,</p>
<p class="i0">Renewed within my frame · its worn and wasted powers;</p>
<p class="i0">I deem the very odors would · have nourished me for hours.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>This induction, which is continued through forty stanzas more, of
unequal merit, is little connected with the stories that follow; the
stories, again, are not at all connected among themselves; and the
whole ends abruptly with a few lines of homage to the Madonna. It
is, therefore, inartificial in its structure throughout. But in the
narrative parts there is often naturalness and spirit, and sometimes,
though rarely, poetry. The tales themselves belong to the religious
fictions of the Middle Ages, and were no doubt intended to excite
de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>vout feelings
in those to whom they were addressed; but, like the old Mysteries,
and much else that passed under the name of religion at the same
period, they often betray a very doubtful morality.<a id="FNanchor_34"
href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>“The Miracles of the Virgin” is not only the longest, but the most
curious, of the poems of Berceo. The rest, however, should not be
entirely neglected. The poem on the “Signs which shall precede the
Judgment” is often solemn, and once or twice rises to poetry; the
story of María de Cisneros, in the “Life of San Domingo,” is well
told, and so is that of the wild appearance in the heavens of Saint
James and Saint Millan fighting for the Christians at the battle of
Simancas, much as it is found in the “General Chronicle of Spain.” But
perhaps nothing is more characteristic of the author or of his age
than the spirit of childlike simplicity and religious tenderness that
breathes through several parts of the “Mourning of the Madonna at the
Cross,”—a spirit of gentle, faithful, credulous devotion, with which
the Spanish people in their wars against the Moors were as naturally
marked as they were with the ignorance that belonged to the Christian
world generally in those dark and troubled times.<a id="FNanchor_35"

<p class="nb">I cannot pass farther without offering the tribute of
my homage to two persons who have done more than any others in the
nineteenth century to make Spanish literature known, and to obtain for
it the honors to which it is entitled beyond the limits of the country
that gave it birth.</p>

<p class="nb">The first of them, and one whose name I have already
cited, is Friedrich Bouterwek, who was born at Oker in the kingdom of
Hanover, in 1766, and passed nearly all the more active portion of his
life at Göttingen, where he died in 1828, widely respected as one of
the most distinguished professors of that long favored University. A
project for preparing by the most competent hands a full history of the
arts and sciences from the period of their revival in modern Europe was
first suggested at Göttingen by another of its well-known professors,
John Gottfried Eichhorn, in the latter part of the eighteenth century.
But though that remarkable scholar published, in 1796-9, two volumes
of a learned Introduction to the whole work which he had projected,
he went no farther, and most of his coadjutors stopped when he did,
or soon afterwards. The portion of it assigned to Bouterwek, however,
which was the entire history of elegant literature in modern times,
was happily achieved by him between 1801 and 1819, in twelve volumes
octavo. Of this division, “The History of Spanish Literature” fills
the third volume, and was published in 1804;—a work remarkable for its
general philosophical views, and by far the best extant on the subject
it discusses; but imperfect in many particulars, because its author
was unable to procure a large number of Spanish books needful for his
task, and knew many considerable Spanish authors only by insufficient
extracts. In 1812, a translation of it into French was printed, in two
volumes, by Madame Streck, with a judicious preface by the venerable
M. Stapfer;—in 1823, it came out, together with its author’s brief
“History of Portuguese Literature,” in an English translation, made
with taste and skill, by Miss Thomasina Ross;—and in 1829, a Spanish
version of the first and smallest part of it, with important notes,
sufficient with the text to fill a volume in octavo, was prepared by
two excellent Spanish scholars, José Gomez de la Cortina, and Nicolás
Hugalde y Mollinedo,—a work which all lovers of Spanish literature
would gladly see completed.</p>

<p class="nb">Since the time of Bouterwek, no foreigner has done so
much to promote a knowledge of Spanish literature as M. Simonde de
Sismondi, who was born at Geneva in 1773, and died there in 1842,
honored and loved by all who knew his wise and generous spirit, as it
exhibited itself either in his personal intercourse, or in his great
works on the history of France and Italy,—two countries, to which, by a
line of time-honored ancestors, he seemed almost equally to belong. In
1811, he delivered in his native city a course of brilliant lectures on
the literature of the South of Europe, and in 1813, published them at
Paris. They involved an account of the Provençal and the Portuguese, as
well as of the Italian and the Spanish;—but in whatever relates to the
Spanish Sismondi was even less well provided with the original authors
than Bouterwek had been, and was, in consequence, under obligations
to his predecessor, which, while he takes no pains to conceal them,
diminish the authority of a work that will yet always be read for the
beauty of its style and the richness and wisdom of its reflections.
The entire series of these lectures was translated into German by
L. Hain in 1815, and into English with notes by T. Roscoe in 1823.
The part relating to Spanish literature was published in Spanish,
with occasional alterations and copious and important additions by
José Lorenzo Figueroa and José Amador de los Rios, at Seville, in 2
vols. 8vo, 1841-2,—the notes relating to Andalusian authors being
particularly valuable.</p>

<p class="nb">None but those who have gone over the whole ground
occupied by Spanish literature can know how great are the merits
of scholars like Bouterwek and Sismondi,—acute, philosophical, and
thoughtful,—who, with an apparatus of authors so incomplete, have yet
done so much for the illustration of their subject.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second known author in Castilian
literature bears a name much more distinguished than the first. It is
Alfonso the Tenth, who, from his great advancement in various branches
of human knowledge, has been called Alfonso the Wise, or the Learned.
He was the son of Ferdinand the Third, a saint in the Roman calendar,
who, uniting anew the crowns of Castile and Leon, and enlarging the
limits of his power by important conquests from the Moors, settled more
firmly than they had before been settled the foundations of a Christian
empire in the Peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Alfonso was born in 1221, and ascended the throne in 1252. He was
a poet, much connected with the Provençal Troubadours of his time,<a
id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and
was besides so greatly skilled in geometry, astronomy, and the
occult sciences then so much valued, that his reputation was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span> early spread throughout
Europe, on account of his general science. But, as Mariana quaintly
says of him, “He was more fit for letters than for the government
of his subjects; he studied the heavens, and watched the stars,
but forgot the earth, and lost his kingdom.”<a id="FNanchor_38"
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>His character is still an interesting one. He appears to have
had more political, philosophical, and elegant learning than any
other man of his time; to have reasoned more wisely in matters of
legislation; and to have made further advances in some of the exact
sciences;—accomplishments that he seems to have resorted to in the
latter part of his life for consolation amidst unsuccessful wars with
foreign enemies and a rebellious son. The following letter from him
to one of the Guzmans, who was then in great favor at the court of
the king of Fez, shows at once how low the fortunes of the Christian
monarch were sunk before he died, and with how much simplicity he
could speak of their bitterness. It is dated in 1282, and is a
favorable specimen of Castilian prose at a period so early in the
history of the language.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p class="mt1">“Cousin Don Alonzo Perez de Guzman: My affliction
is great, because it has fallen from such a height that it will be
seen afar; and as it has fallen on me, who was the friend of all the
world, so in all the world will men know this my misfortune, and
its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> sharpness,
which I suffer unjustly from my son, assisted by my friends and by
my prelates, who, instead of setting peace between us, have put
mischief, not under secret pretences or covertly, but with bold
openness. And thus I find no protection in mine own land, neither
defender nor champion; and yet have I not deserved it at their
hands, unless it were for the good I have done them. And now, since
in mine own land they deceive, who should have served and assisted
me, needful is it that I should seek abroad those who will kindly
care for me; and since they of Castile have been false to me,
none can think it ill that I ask help among those of Benamarin.<a
id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> For
if my sons are mine enemies, it will not then be wrong that I take
mine enemies to be my sons; enemies according to the law, but not of
free choice. And such is the good king Aben Jusaf; for I love and
value him much, and he will not despise me or fail me; for we are
at truce. I know also how much you are his, and how much he loves
you, and with good cause, and how much he will do through your good
counsel. Therefore look not at the things past, but at the things
present. Consider of what lineage you are come, and that at some time
hereafter I may do you good, and if I do it not, that your own good
deed shall be its own good reward. Therefore, my cousin, Alonzo Perez
de Guzman, do so much for me with my lord and your friend, that,
on pledge of the most precious crown that I have, and the jewels
thereof, he should lend me so much as he may hold to be just. And if
you can obtain his aid, let it not be hindered of coming quickly; but
rather think how the good friendship that may<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> come to me from your lord will be through
your hands. And so may God’s friendship be with you. Done in Seville,
my only loyal city, in the thirtieth year of my reign, and in the
first of these my troubles.</p>

<p class="firma">Signed, <span class="smcap">The King</span>.”<a
id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p class="mt1">The unhappy monarch survived the date of this very
striking letter but two years, and died in 1284. At one period of his
life, his consideration throughout Christendom was so great, that he
was elected Emperor of Germany; but this was only another source of
sorrow to him, for his claims were contested, and after some time were
silently set aside by the election of Rodolph of Hapsburg, upon whose
dynasty the glories of the House of Austria rested so long. The life of
Alfonso, therefore, was on the whole unfortunate, and full of painful
vicissitudes, that might well have broken the spirit of most men, and
that were certainly not without an effect on his.<a id="FNanchor_42"
href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>So much the more remarkable is it, that he should be distinguished
among the chief founders of his country’s intellectual fame,—a
distinction which again becomes more extraordinary when we recollect
that he enjoys it not in letters alone, or in a single department, but
in many; since he is to be remembered alike for the great advancement
which Castilian prose composition made in his hands, for his poetry,
for his astronomical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span>
tables, which all the progress of science since has not deprived
of their value; and for his great work on legislation, which is at
this moment an authority in both hemispheres.<a id="FNanchor_43"
href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Of his poetry, we possess, besides works of very doubtful
genuineness, two, about one of which there has been little question,
and about the other none; his “Cántigas,” or Chants, in honor of the
Madonna, and his “Tesoro,” a treatise on the transmutation of the baser
metals into gold.</p>

<p>Of the Cántigas, there are extant no less than four hundred
and one, composed in lines of from six to twelve syllables, and
rhymed with a considerable degree of exactness.<a id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Their measure and
manner are Provençal. They are devoted to the praises and the
miracles of the Madonna, in whose honor the king founded in 1279 a
religious and military order;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45"
class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and in devotion<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span> to whom, by his last will, he directed
these poems to be perpetually chanted in the church of Saint Mary of
Murcia, where he desired his body might be buried.<a id="FNanchor_46"
href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Only a few of them have
been printed; but we have enough to show what they are, and especially
that they are written, not in the Castilian, like the rest of his
works, but in the Galician; an extraordinary circumstance, for which it
does not seem easy to give a satisfactory reason.</p>

<p>The Galician, however, was originally an important language in
Spain, and for some time seemed as likely to prevail throughout the
country as any other of the dialects spoken in it. It was probably the
first that was developed in the northwestern part of the Peninsula,
and the second that was reduced to writing. For in the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, just at the period when the struggling elements of
the modern Spanish were disencumbering themselves from the forms of the
corrupted Latin, Galicia, by the wars and troubles of the times, was
repeatedly separated from Castile, so that distinct dialects appeared
in the two different territories almost at the same moment. Of these,
the Northern is likely to have been the older, though the Southern
proved ultimately the more fortunate. At any rate, even without a
court, which was the surest centre of culture in such rude ages, and
without any of the reasons for the development of a dialect which
always accompany political power, we know that the Galician was already
sufficiently formed to pass with the conquering arms of Alfonso the
Sixth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span> establish
itself firmly between the Douro and the Minho; that country which
became the nucleus of the independent kingdom of Portugal.</p>

<p>This was between the years 1095 and 1109; and though the
establishment of a Burgundian dynasty on the throne erected there
naturally brought into the dialect of Portugal an infusion of
the French, which never appeared in the dialect of Galicia,<a
id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
still the language spoken in the two territories under different
sovereigns and different influences continued substantially the same
for a long period; perhaps down to the time of Charles the Fifth.<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But
it was only in Portugal that there was a court, or that means and
motives were found sufficient for forming and cultivating a regular
language. It is therefore only in Portugal that this common dialect of
both the territories appears with a separate and proper literature;<a
id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
the first intimation of which, with an exact date, is found as
early as 1192. This is a document in prose.<a id="FNanchor_50"
href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The oldest poetry is to
be sought in three curious fragments, originally published by Faria
y Sousa, which can hardly be placed much later than the year 1200.<a
id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Both
show that the Galician in Portugal, under less favorable circumstances
than those which accompanied the Castilian in Spain, rose at the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> same period to be a written
language, and possessed, perhaps, quite as early, the materials for
forming an independent literature.</p>

<p>We may fairly infer, therefore, from these facts, indicating
the vigor of the Galician in Portugal before the year 1200, that,
in its native province in Spain, it is somewhat older. But we
have no monuments by which to establish such antiquity. Castro,
it is true, notices a manuscript translation of the history of
Servandus, as if made in 1150 by Seguino, in the Galician dialect;
but he gives no specimen of it, and his own authority in such a
matter is not sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> And in the well-known letter sent to the
Constable of Portugal by the Marquis of Santillana, about the middle
of the fifteenth century, we are told that all Spanish poetry was
written for a long time in Galician or Portuguese;<a id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> but this is so obviously
either a mistake in fact, or a mere compliment to the Portuguese prince
to whom it was addressed, that Sarmiento, full of prejudices in favor
of his native province, and desirous to arrive at the same conclusion,
is obliged to give it up as wholly unwarranted.<a id="FNanchor_54"
href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>We must come back, therefore, to the “Cántigas” or Chants of
Alfonso, as to the oldest specimen extant in the Galician dialect
distinct from the Portuguese; and since, from internal evidence,
one of them was written after he had conquered Xerez, we may place
them between 1263, when that event occurred, and 1284, when<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span> he died.<a id="FNanchor_55"
href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Why he should have chosen
this particular dialect for this particular form of poetry, when he
had, as we know, an admirable mastery of the Castilian, and when
these Cántigas, according to his last will, were to be chanted over
his tomb, in a part of the kingdom where the Galician dialect never
prevailed, we cannot now decide.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56"
class="fnanchor">[56]</a> His father, Saint Ferdinand, was from the
North, and his own early nurture there may have given Alfonso himself a
strong affection for its language; or, what perhaps is more probable,
there may have been something in the dialect itself, its origin or
its gravity, which, at a period when no dialect in Spain had obtained
an acknowledged supremacy, made it seem to him better suited than the
Castilian or Valencian to religious purposes.</p>

<p>But however this may be, all the rest of his works are in the
language spoken in the centre of the Peninsula, while his Cántigas
are in the Galician. Some of them have considerable poetical merit;
but in general they are to be remarked only for the variety of their
metres, for an occasional tendency to the form of ballads, for a
lyrical tone, which does not seem to have been earlier established
in the Castilian, and for a kind of Doric simplicity, which belongs
partly to the dialect he adopted and partly to the character of the
author himself;—the whole bearing the impress of the Provençal poets,
with whom he was much connected, and whom through life he patronized
and maintained at his court.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span>The other
poetry attributed to Alfonso—except two stanzas that remain of his
“Complaints” against the hard fortune of the last years of his life<a
id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>—is to
be sought in the treatise called “Del Tesoro,” which is divided into
two short books, and dated in 1272. It is on the Philosopher’s Stone,
and the greater portion of it is concealed in an unexplained cipher;
the remainder being partly in prose and partly in octave stanzas, which
are the oldest extant in Castilian verse. But the whole is worthless,
and its genuineness doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>Alfonso claims
his chief distinction in letters as a writer of prose. In this his
merit is great. He first made the Castilian a national language by
causing the Bible to be translated into it, and by requiring it to be
used in all legal proceedings;<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and he first, by his great Code and other
works, gave specimens of prose composition which left a free and
disencumbered course for all that has been done since,—a service
perhaps greater than it has been permitted any other Spaniard to
render the prose literature of his country. To this, therefore, we now
turn.</p>

<p>And here the first work we meet with is one that was rather compiled
under his direction, than written by himself. It is called “The Great
Conquest beyond Sea,” and is an account of the wars in the Holy Land,
which then so much agitated the minds of men throughout Europe,
and which were intimately connected with the fate of the Christian
Spaniards still struggling for their own existence in a perpetual
crusade against misbelief at home. It begins with the history of
Mohammed, and comes down to the year 1270; much of it being taken from
an old French version of the work of William of Tyre, on the same
general subject, and the rest from other less trustworthy sources. But
parts of it are not historical. The grandfather of Godfrey of Bouillon,
its hero, is the wild and fanciful Knight of the Swan, who is almost
as much a representative of the spirit of chivalry as Amadis de Gaul,
and goes through adventures no less marvellous; fighting on the Rhine
like a knight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span>-errant,
and miraculously warned by a swallow how to rescue his lady, who has
been made prisoner. Unhappily, in the only edition of this curious
work,—printed in 1503,—the text has received additions that make us
doubtful how much of it may be certainly ascribed to the time of
Alfonso the Tenth, in whose reign and by whose order the greater
part of it seems to have been prepared. It is chiefly valuable as a
specimen of early Spanish prose.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Castilian prose, in fact, can hardly be said to have existed
earlier, unless we are willing to reckon as specimens of it the few
meagre documents, generally grants in hard legal forms, that begin
with the one concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p.
47]</span> Avilés in 1155, already noticed, and come down, half
bad Latin and half unformed Spanish, to the time of Alfonso.<a
id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The
first monument, therefore, that can be properly cited for this purpose,
though it dates from the reign of Saint Ferdinand, the father of
Alfonso, is one in preparing which, it has always been supposed,
Alfonso himself was personally concerned. It is the “Fuero Juzgo,”
or “Forum Judicum,” a collection of Visigoth laws, which, in 1241,
after his conquest of Córdova, Saint Ferdinand sent to that city in
Latin, with directions that it should be translated into the vulgar
dialect, and observed there as the law of the territory he had then
newly rescued from the Moors.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The precise time when this translation was made has<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> not been decided. Marina,
whose opinion should have weight, thinks it was not till the reign of
Alfonso; but, from the early authority we know it possessed, it is
perhaps more probable that it is to be dated from the latter years of
Saint Ferdinand. In either case, however, considering the peculiar
character and position of Alfonso, there can be little doubt that he
was consulted and concerned in its preparation. It is a regular code,
divided into twelve books, which are subdivided into titles and laws,
and is of an extent so considerable and of a character so free and
discursive, that we can fairly judge from it the condition of the prose
language of the time, and ascertain that it was already as far advanced
as the contemporaneous poetry.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>But the wise forecast of Saint Ferdinand soon extended beyond
the purpose with which he originally commanded the translation of
the old Visigoth laws, and he undertook to prepare a code for the
whole of Christian Spain that was under his sceptre, which, in its
different cities and provinces, was distracted by different and often
contradictory <i>fueros</i> or privileges and laws given to each as it
was won from the common enemy. But he did not live to execute his
beneficent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span> project,
and the fragment that still remains to us of what he undertook,
commonly known by the name of the “Setenario,” plainly implies that it
is, in part at least, the work of his son Alfonso.<a id="FNanchor_65"
href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Still, though Alfonso had been employed in preparing this code,
he did not see fit to finish it. He, however, felt charged with the
general undertaking, and seemed determined that his kingdom should
not continue to suffer from the uncertainty or the conflict of its
different systems of legislation. But he proceeded with great caution.
His first body of laws, called the “Espejo,” or “Mirror of all Rights,”
filling five books, was prepared before 1255; but though it contains
within itself directions for its own distribution and enforcement,
it does not seem ever to have gone into practical use. His “Fuero
Real,” a shorter code, divided into four books, was completed in 1255
for Valladolid, and perhaps was subsequently given to other cities
of his kingdom. Both were followed by different laws, as occasion
called for them, down nearly to the end of his reign. But all of them,
taken together, were far from constituting a code such as had been
projected by Saint Ferdinand.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>This last great work was undertaken by Alfonso in 1256, and finished
either in 1263 or 1265. It was originally called by Alfonso himself “El
Setenario,” from the title of the code undertaken by his father; but
it is now always called “Las Siete Partidas,” or<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span> The Seven Parts, from the seven divisions
of the work itself. That Alfonso was assisted by others in the great
task of compiling it out of the Decretals, and the Digest and Code
of Justinian, as well as out of the Fuero Juzgo and other sources of
legislation, both Spanish and foreign, is not to be doubted; but the
general air and finish of the whole, its style and literary execution,
must be more or less his own, so much are they in harmony with
whatever else we know of his works and character.<a id="FNanchor_67"
href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The Partidas, however, though by far the most important legislative
monument of its age, did not become at once the law of the land.<a
id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> On
the contrary, the great cities, with their separate privileges, long
resisted any thing like a uniform system of legislation for the whole
country; and it was not till 1348, two years before the death of
Alfonso the Eleventh, and above sixty after that of their author,
that the Partidas were finally proclaimed as of binding authority in
all the territories held by the kings of Castile and Leon. But from
that period the great code of Alfonso has been uniformly respected.<a
id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It
is, in fact, a sort of Spanish common law, which, with the decisions
under it, has been the basis of Spanish jurisprudence ever since; and
becoming in this way a part of the constitution of the state in all
Spanish colonies, it has, from the time when Louisiana and Florida
were added to the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p.
51]</span> States, become in some cases the law in our own country;—so
wide may be the influence of a wise legislation.<a id="FNanchor_70"
href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The Partidas, however, read very little like a collection of
statutes, or even like a code such as that of Justinian or Napoleon.
They seem rather to be a series of treatises on legislation, morals,
and religion, divided with great formality, according to their
subjects, into Parts, Titles, and Laws; the last of which, instead
of being merely imperative ordinances, enter into arguments and
investigations of various sorts, often discussing the moral principles
they lay down, and often containing intimations of the manners
and opinions of the age, that make them a curious mine of Spanish
antiquities. They are, in short, a kind of digested result of the
opinions and reading of a learned monarch, and his coadjutors, in the
thirteenth century, on the relative duties of a king and his subjects,
and on the entire legislation and police, ecclesiastical, civil, and
moral, to which, in their judgment, Spain should be subjected; the
whole interspersed with discussions, sometimes more quaint than grave,
concerning the customs and principles on which the work itself, or some
particular part of it, is founded.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the style of the Partidas, an ex<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span>tract may be made from a
law entitled “What meaneth a Tyrant, and how he useth his power in a
kingdom when he hath obtained it.”</p>

<p>“A tyrant,” says this law, “doth signify a cruel lord, who by force,
or by craft, or by treachery, hath obtained power over any realm or
country; and such men be of such nature, that, when once they have
grown strong in the land, they love rather to work their own profit,
though it be in harm of the land, than the common profit of all, for
they always live in an ill fear of losing it. And that they may be
able to fulfil this their purpose unencumbered, the wise of old have
said that they use their power against the people in three manners.
The first is, that they strive that those under their mastery be ever
ignorant and timorous, because, when they be such, they may not be bold
to rise against them nor to resist their wills; and the second is, that
they be not kindly and united among themselves, in such wise that they
trust not one another, for, while they live in disagreement, they shall
not dare to make any discourse against their lord, for fear faith and
secrecy should not be kept among themselves; and the third way is, that
they strive to make them poor, and to put them upon great undertakings,
which they can never finish, whereby they may have so much harm, that
it may never come into their hearts to devise any thing against their
ruler. And above all this, have tyrants ever striven to make spoil of
the strong and to destroy the wise; and have forbidden fellowship and
assemblies of men in their land, and striven always to know what men
said or did; and do trust their counsel and the guard of their person
rather to foreigners, who will serve at their will, than to them of the
land, who serve from oppression. And, moreover, we say, that, though
any man may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span>
gained mastery of a kingdom by any of the lawful means whereof we
have spoken in the laws going before this, yet, if he use his power
ill, in the ways whereof we speak in this law, him may the people
still call tyrant; for he turneth his mastery which was rightful into
wrongful, as Aristotle hath said in the book which treateth of the rule
and government of kingdoms.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In other laws, reasons are given why kings and their sons
should be taught to read;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72"
class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and in a law about the governesses of king’s
daughters, it is declared:—</p>

<p>“They are to endeavour, as much as may be, that the king’s daughters
be moderate and seemly in eating and in drinking, and also in their
carriage and dress, and of good manners in all things, and especially
that they be not given to anger; for, besides the wickedness that lieth
in it, it is the thing in the world that most easily leadeth women
to do ill. And they ought to teach them to be handy in performing
those works that belong to noble ladies; for this is a matter that
becometh them much, since they obtain by it cheerfulness and a quiet
spirit; and besides, it taketh away bad thoughts, which it is not
convenient they should have.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Many of the laws concerning knights, like one on their loyalty,
and one on the meaning of the ceremonies used when they are armed,<a
id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
and all the laws on the establishment and conduct of great public
schools, which he was endeavouring, at the same time, to encourage,
by the privileges he granted to Salamanca,<a id="FNanchor_75"
href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> are<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span> written with even more skill and selectness
of idiom. Indeed, the Partidas, in whatever relates to manner and
style, are not only superior to any thing that had preceded them, but
to any thing that for a long time followed. The poems of Berceo, hardly
twenty years older, seem to belong to another age, and to a much ruder
state of society; and, on the other hand, Marina, whose opinion on such
a subject few are entitled to call in question, says, that, during the
two or even three centuries subsequent, nothing was produced in Spanish
prose equal to the Partidas for purity and elevation of style.<a
id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>But however this may be, there is no doubt, that, mingled with
something of the rudeness and more of the ungraceful repetitions
common in the period to which they belong, there is a richness, an
appropriateness, and sometimes even an elegance, in their turns of
expression, truly remarkable. They show that the great effort of their
author to make the Castilian the living and real language of his
country, by making it that of the laws and the tribunals of justice,
had been successful, or was destined speedily to become so. Their
grave and measured movement, and the solemnity of their tone, which
have remained among the characteristics of Spanish prose ever since,
show this success beyond all reasonable question. They show, too, the
character of Alfonso himself, giving token of a far-reaching wisdom
and philosophy, and proving how much a single great mind happily
placed can do towards imparting their final direction to the language
and literature of a country, even so early as the first century of
their separate existence.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77"

  <h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
  <p class="subh3 hang"><span class="smcap">Juan Lorenzo Segura.
  — Confusion of Ancient and Modern Manners. — El Alexandro, its
  Story and Merits. — Los Votos del Pavon. — Sancho el Bravo. — Don
  Juan Manuel, his Life and Works, published and unpublished. — His
  Conde Lucanor.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> proof that the “Partidas” were in
advance of their age, both as to style and language, is plain, not
only from the examination we have made of what preceded them, but from
a comparison of them, which we must now make, with the poetry of Juan
Lorenzo Segura, who lived at the time they were compiled, and probably
somewhat later. Like Berceo, he was a secular priest, and he belonged
to Astorga; but this is all we know of him, except that he lived in
the latter part of the thirteenth century, and has left a poem of
above ten thousand lines on the life of Alexander the Great, drawn
from such sources as were then accessible to a Spanish ecclesiastic,
and written in the four-line stanza used by Berceo.<a id="FNanchor_78"
href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>What is most obvious in this long poem is its confounding the
manners of a well-known age of Grecian antiquity with those of the
Catholic religion, and of knighthood, as they existed in the days
of its author. Similar confusion is found in some portion of the
early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> literature of
every country in modern Europe. In all, there was a period when the
striking facts of ancient history, and the picturesque fictions of
ancient fable, floating about among the traditions of the Middle Ages,
were seized upon as materials for poetry and romance; and when, to fill
up and finish the picture presented by their imaginations to those who
thus misapplied an imperfect knowledge of antiquity, the manners and
feelings of their own times were incongruously thrown in, either from
an ignorant persuasion that none other had ever existed, or from a
wilful carelessness concerning every thing but poetical effect. This
was the case in Italy, from the first dawning of letters till after the
time of Dante; the sublime and tender poetry of whose “Divina Commedia”
is full of such absurdities and anachronisms. It was the case, too, in
France; examples singularly in point being found in the Latin poem of
Walter de Chatillon, and the French one by Alexandre de Paris, on this
same subject of Alexander the Great; both of which were written nearly
a century before Juan Lorenzo lived, and both of which were used by
him.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
And it was the case in England, till after the time of Shakspeare,
whose “Midsummer Night’s Dream” does all that genius can do to justify
it. We must not, therefore, be surprised to find it in Spain, where,
derived from such monstrous repositories of fiction as the works of
Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis, Guido de Colonna and Walter de
Chatillon, some of the histories and fancies of ancient times already
filled the thoughts of those men who were unconsciously begin<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>ning the fabric of their
country’s literature on foundations essentially different.</p>

<p>Among the most attractive subjects that offered themselves to
such persons was that of Alexander the Great. The East—Persia,
Arabia, and India—had long been full of stories of his adventures;<a
id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and now,
in the West, as a hero more nearly approaching the spirit of knighthood
than any other of antiquity, he was adopted into the poetical fictions
of almost every nation that could boast the beginning of a literature,
so that the Monk in the “Canterbury Tales” said truly,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">“The storie of Alexandre is so commune,</p>
<p class="i0">That every wight, that hath discretion,</p>
<p class="i0">Hath herd somewhat or all of his fortune.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Juan Lorenzo took this story substantially as he had read it in
the “Alexandreïs” of Walter de Chatillon, whom he repeatedly cites;<a
id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> but he
has added whatever he found elsewhere, or in his own imagination, that
seemed suited to his purpose, which was by no means that of becoming a
mere translator. After a short introduction, he comes at once to his
subject thus, in the fifth stanza:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I desire to teach the story · of a noble pagan king,</p>
<p class="i0">With whose valor and bold heart · the world once did ring:</p>
<p class="i0">For the world he overcame, · like a very little thing;</p>
<p class="i0">And a clerkly name I shall gain, · if his story I can sing.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">This prince was Alexander, · and Greece it was his right;</p>
<p class="i0">Frank and bold he was in arms, · and in knowledge took delight;</p>
<p class="i0">Darius’ power he overthrew, · and Porus, kings of might,</p>
<p class="i0">And for suffering and for patience · the world held no such wight.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">Now the infant Alexander · showed plainly from the first,</p>
<p class="i0">That he through every hindrance · with prowess great would burst;</p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>
<p class="i0">For by a servile breast · he never would be nursed,</p>
<p class="i0">And less than gentle lineage · to serve him never durst.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And mighty signs when he was born · foretold his coming worth:</p>
<p class="i0">The air was troubled, and the sun · his brightness put not forth,</p>
<p class="i0">The sea was angry all, · and shook the solid earth,</p>
<p class="i0">The world was wellnigh perishing · for terror at his birth.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Then comes the history of Alexander, mingled with the fables and
extravagances of the times; given generally with the dulness of a
chronicle, but sometimes showing a poetical spirit. Before setting out
on his grand expedition to the East, he is knighted, and receives an
enchanted sword made by Don Vulcan, a girdle made by Doña Philosophy,
and a shirt made by two sea fairies,—<i>duas fadas enna mar</i>.<a
id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The
conquest of Asia follows soon afterwards, in the course of which the
Bishop of Jerusalem orders mass to be said to stay the conqueror, as he
approaches the Jewish capital.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In general, the known outline of Alexander’s adventures is
followed, but there are a good many whimsical digressions; and when
the Macedonian forces pass the site of Troy, the poet cannot resist
the temptation of making an abstract of the fortunes and fate of
that city, which he represents as told by Don Alexander himself to
his followers, and especially to the Twelve Peers, who accompanied
him in his expedition.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Homer is vouched as authority for
the extraordinary narrative that is given;<a id="FNanchor_86"
href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> but how little the
poet of Astorga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span>
cared for the Iliad and Odyssey may be inferred from the fact, that,
instead of sending Achilles, or Don Achilles, as he is called, to the
court of Lycomedes of Scyros, to be concealed in woman’s clothes,
he is sent, by the enchantments of his mother, in female attire,
to a convent of nuns, and the crafty Don Ulysses goes there as a
peddler, with a pack of female ornaments and martial weapons on his
back, to detect the fraud.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87"
class="fnanchor">[87]</a> But, with all its defects and incongruities,
the “Alexandro” is a curious and important landmark in early Spanish
literature; and if it is written with less purity and dignity than the
“Partidas” of Alfonso, it has still a truly Castilian air, in both its
language and its versification.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>A poem called “Los Votos del Pavon,” The Vows of the Peacock,
which was a continuation of the “Alexandro,” is lost. If we may
judge from an old French poem on the vows made over a peacock that
had been a favorite bird of Alexander, and was served accidentally
at table after that hero’s death, we have no reason to complain of
our loss as a misfortune.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89"
class="fnanchor">[89]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p.
61]</span> Nor have we probably great occasion to regret that we
possess only extracts from a prose book of advice, prepared for his
heir and successor by Sancho, the son of Alfonso the Tenth; for
though, from the chapter warning the young prince against fools, we
see that it wanted neither sense nor spirit, still it is not to be
compared to the “Partidas” for precision, grace, or dignity of style.<a
id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> We come,
therefore, at once to a remarkable writer, who flourished a little
later,—the Prince Don Juan Manuel.</p>

<p>Lorenzo was an ecclesiastic,—<i>bon clérigo é ondrado</i>,—and his home
was at Astorga, in the northwestern portion of Spain, on the borders of
Leon and Galicia. Berceo belonged to the same territory, and, though
there may be half a century between them, they are of a similar spirit.
We are glad, therefore, that the next author we meet, Don John Manuel,
takes us from the mountains of the North to the chivalry of the South,
and to the state of society, the conflicts, manners, and interests,
that gave us the “Poem of the Cid,” and the code of the “Partidas.”</p>

<p>Don John was of the blood royal of Castile and Leon; grandson of
Saint Ferdinand, nephew of Alfonso the Wise, and one of the most
turbulent and dangerous of the Spanish barons of his time. He was born
in Escalona, on the 5th of May, 1282, and was the son of Don Pedro
Manuel, an Infante of Spain,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91"
class="fnanchor">[91]</a> brother of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span> Alfonso the Wise, with whom he always had
his officers and household in common. Before Don John was two years
old, his father died, and he was educated by his cousin, Sancho the
Fourth, living with him on a footing like that on which his father
had lived with Alfonso.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92"
class="fnanchor">[92]</a> When twelve years old he was already in the
field against the Moors, and in 1310, at the age of twenty-eight, he
had reached the most considerable offices in the state; but Ferdinand
the Fourth dying two years afterwards, and leaving Alfonso the
Eleventh, his successor, only thirteen months old, great disturbances
followed till 1320, when Don John Manuel became joint regent of the
realm; a place which he suffered none to share with him, but such
of his near relations as were most involved in his interests.<a
id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The affairs of the kingdom during the administration of Prince
John seem to have been managed with talent and spirit; but at the end
of the regency the young monarch was not sufficiently contented with
the state of things to continue his grand-uncle in any considerable
employment. Don John, however, was not of a temper to submit quietly
to affront or neglect.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> He left the court at Valladolid, and prepared
himself, with all his great resources, for the armed opposition which
the politics of the time regarded as a justifiable mode of obtaining
redress. The king was alarmed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p.
63]</span> “for he saw,” says the old chronicler, “that they were the
most powerful men in his kingdom, and that they could do grievous
battle with him, and great mischief to the land.” He entered,
therefore, into an arrangement with Prince John, who did not hesitate
to abandon his friends, and go back to his allegiance, on the condition
that the king should marry his daughter Constantia, then a mere child,
and create him governor of the provinces bordering on the Moors, and
commander-in-chief of the Moorish war; thus placing him, in fact, again
at the head of the kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>From this time we find him actively engaged on the frontiers
in a succession of military operations, till 1327, when he gained
over the Moors the important victory of Guadalhorra. But the same
year was marked by the bloody treachery of the king against Prince
John’s uncle, who was murdered in the palace under circumstances
of peculiar atrocity.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The Prince immediately retired in disgust
to his estates, and began again to muster his friends and forces for
a contest, into which he rushed the more eagerly, as the king had now
refused to consummate his union with Constantia, and had married a
Portuguese princess. The war which followed was carried on with various
success till 1335, when Prince John was finally subdued, and, entering
anew into the king’s service, with fresh reputation, as it seemed, from
a spirited rebellion, and marrying his daughter Constantia, now grown
up, to the heir-apparent of Portugal, went on, as commander-in-chief,
with an uninterrupted succession of victories over the Moors,
until almost the moment of his death, which happened in 1347.<a
id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>In a life like
this, full of intrigues and violence,—from a prince like this, who
married the sisters of two kings, who had two other kings for his
sons-in-law, and who disturbed his country by his rebellions and
military enterprises for above thirty years,—we should hardly look for
a successful attempt in letters.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Yet so it is. Spanish poetry, we know, first
appeared in the midst of turbulence and danger; and now we find Spanish
prose fiction springing forth from the same soil, and under similar
circumstances. Down to this time we have seen no prose of much value in
the prevailing Castilian dialect, except in the works of Alfonso the
Tenth, and in one or two chronicles that will hereafter be noticed.
But in most of these the fervor which seems to be an essential element
of the early Spanish genius was kept in check, either by the nature
of their subjects, or by circumstances of which we can now have no
knowledge; and it is not until a fresh attempt is made, in the midst
of the wars and tumults that for centuries seem to have been as the
principle of life to the whole Peninsula, that we discover in Spanish
prose a decided development of such forms as afterwards became national
and characteristic.</p>

<p>Don John, to whom belongs the distinction of producing one of
these forms, showed himself worthy of a family in which, for above
a century, letters had been honored and cultivated. He is known to
have written twelve works; and so anxious was he about their fate,
that he caused them to be carefully transcribed in a large volume,
and bequeathed them to a monastery he had founded on his estates at
Peñafiel, as a burial-place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p.
65]</span> for himself and his descendants.<a id="FNanchor_99"
href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> How many of these
works are now in existence is not known. Some are certainly among
the treasures of the National Library at Madrid, in a manuscript
which seems to be an imperfect and injured copy of the one originally
deposited at Peñafiel. Two others may, perhaps, yet be recovered; for
one of them, the “Chronicle of Spain,” abridged by Don John from that
of his uncle, Alfonso the Wise, was in the possession of the Marquis of
Mondejar in the middle of the eighteenth century;<a id="FNanchor_100"
href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and the other,
a treatise on Hunting, was seen by Pellicer somewhat later.<a
id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> A
collection of Don John’s poems, which Argote de Molina intended to
publish in the time of Philip the Second, is probably lost, since
the diligent Sanchez sought for it in vain;<a id="FNanchor_102"
href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and his “Conde Lucanor”
alone has been placed beyond the reach of accident by being printed.<a
id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span>All that we
possess of Don John Manuel is important. The imperfect manuscript at
Madrid opens with an account of the reasons why he had caused his works
to be transcribed; reasons which he illustrates by the following story,
very characteristic of his age.</p>

<p>“In the time of King Jayme the First of Majorca,” says he, “there
was a knight of Perpignan, who was a great Troubadour, and made brave
songs wonderfully well. But one that he made was better than the rest,
and, moreover, was set to good music. And people were so delighted with
that song, that, for a long time, they would sing no other. And so the
knight that made it was well pleased. But one day, going through the
streets, he heard a shoemaker singing this song, and he sang it so
ill, both in words and tune, that any man who had not heard it before
would have held it to be a very poor song, and very ill made. Now when
the knight heard that shoemaker spoil his good work, he was full of
grief and anger, and got down from his beast, and sat down by him.
But the shoemaker gave no heed to the knight, and did not cease from
singing; and the further he sang, the worse he spoiled the song that
knight had made. And when the knight heard his good work so spoiled
by the foolishness of the shoe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p.
67]</span>maker, he took up very gently some shears that lay there, and
cut all the shoemaker’s shoes in pieces, and mounted his beast and rode
away.</p>

<p>“Now, when the shoemaker saw his shoes, and beheld how they were cut
in pieces, and that he had lost all his labor, he was much troubled,
and went shouting after the knight that had done it. And the knight
answered: ‘My friend, our lord the king, as you well know, is a good
king and a just. Let us, then, go to him, and let him determine, as
may seem right, the difference between us.’ And they were agreed to
do so. And when they came before the king, the shoemaker told him how
all his shoes had been cut in pieces and much harm done to him. And
the king was wroth at it, and asked the knight if this were truth.
And the knight said that it was; but that he would like to say why
he did it. And the king told him to say on. And the knight answered,
that the king well knew that he had made a song,—the one that was very
good and had good music,—and he said, that the shoemaker had spoiled
it in singing; in proof whereof, he prayed the king to command him
now to sing it. And the king did so, and saw how he spoiled it. Then
the knight said, that, since the shoemaker had spoiled the good work
he had made with great pains and labor, so he might spoil the works
of the shoemaker. And the king and all they that were there with
him were very merry at this and laughed; and the king commanded the
shoemaker never to sing that song again, nor trouble the good work of
the knight; but the king paid the shoemaker for the harm that was done
him, and commanded the knight not to vex the shoemaker any more.<a
id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span></p>

<p>“And now, knowing that I cannot hinder the books I have made from
being copied many times, and seeing that in copies one thing is put for
another, either because he who copies is ignorant, or because one word
looks so much like another, and so the meaning and sense are changed
without any fault in him who first wrote it; therefore, I, Don John
Manuel, to avoid this wrong as much as I may, have caused this volume
to be made, in which are written out all the works I have composed, and
they are twelve.”</p>

<p>Of the twelve works here referred to, the Madrid manuscript contains
only three. One is a long letter to his brother, the Archbishop of
Toledo, and Chancellor of the kingdom, in which he gives, first, an
account of his family arms; then the reason why he and his right
heirs male could make knights without having received any order of
knighthood, as he himself had done when he was not yet two years old;
and lastly, the report of a solemn conversation he had held with Sancho
the Fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span> on his
death-bed, in which the king bemoaned himself bitterly, that, having
for his rebellion justly received the curse of his father, Alfonso
the Wise, he had now no power to give a dying man’s blessing to Don
John.</p>

<p>Another of the works in the Madrid manuscript is a treatise in
twenty-six chapters, called “Counsels to his Son Ferdinand”; which is,
in fact, an essay on the Christian and moral duties of one destined by
his rank to the highest places in the state, referring sometimes to the
more ample discussions on similar subjects in Don John’s treatise on
the Different Estates or Conditions of Men, apparently a longer work,
not now known to exist.</p>

<p>But the third and longest is the most interesting. It is “The Book
of the Knight and the Esquire,” “written,” says the author, “in the
manner called in Castile <i>fabliella</i>,” (a little fable,) and sent to
his brother, the Archbishop, that he might translate it into Latin; a
proof, and not the only one, that Don John placed small value upon the
language to which he now owes all his honors. The book itself contains
an account of a young man who, encouraged by the good condition of
his country under a king that called his Cortes together often, and
gave his people good teachings and good laws, determines to seek
advancement in the state. On his way to a meeting of the Cortes,
where he intends to be knighted, he meets a retired cavalier, who in
his hermitage explains to him all the duties and honors of chivalry,
and thus prepares him for the distinction to which he aspires. On
his return, he again visits his aged friend, and is so delighted
with his instructions, that he remains with him, ministering to his
infirmities and profiting by his wisdom, till his death, after which
the young knight goes to his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p.
70]</span> land, and lives there in great honor the rest of his
life. The story, or little fable, is, however, a very slight thread,
serving only to hold together a long series of instructions on the
moral duties of men, and on the different branches of human knowledge,
given with earnestness and spirit, in the fashion of the times.<a
id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The “Conde Lucanor,” the best known of its author’s works,
bears some resemblance to the fable of the Knight and the Esquire.
It is a collection of forty-nine tales,<a id="FNanchor_106"
href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> anecdotes, and
apologues, clearly in the Oriental manner; the first hint for which was
probably taken from the “Disciplina Clericalis” of Petrus Alphonsus, a
collection of Latin stories made in Spain about two centuries earlier.
The occasion on which the tales of Don John are supposed to be related
is, like the fictions themselves, invented with Eastern simplicity,
and reminds us constantly of the “Thousand and One Nights,” and their
multitudinous imitations.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span>The Count
Lucanor—a personage of power and consideration, intended probably to
represent those early Christian counts in Spain, who, like Fernan
Gonzalez of Castile, were, in fact, independent princes—finds himself
occasionally perplexed with questions of morals and public policy.
These questions, as they occur, he proposes to Patronio, his minister
or counsellor, and Patronio replies to each by a tale or a fable,
which is ended with a rhyme in the nature of a moral. The stories are
various in their character.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Sometimes it is an anecdote in Spanish
history to which Don John resorts, like that of the three knights
of his grandfather, Saint Ferdinand, at the siege of Seville.<a
id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
More frequently, it is a sketch of some striking trait in the
national manners, like the story of “Rodrigo el Franco and his
three Faithful Followers.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110"
class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Sometimes, again, it is a fiction of
chivalry, like that of the “Hermit and Richard the Lion-Hearted.”<a
id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
And sometimes it is an apologue, like that of the “Old Man, his Son,
and the Ass,” or that of the “Crow persuaded by the Fox to sing,”
which, with his many successors, he must in some<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span> way or other have obtained from Æsop.<a
id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> They
are all curious, but probably the most interesting is the “Moorish
Marriage,” partly because it points distinctly to an Arabic origin, and
partly because it remarkably resembles the story Shakspeare has used
in his “Taming of the Shrew.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a> It is, however, too long to be given here;
and therefore a shorter specimen will be taken from the twenty-second
chapter, entitled “Of what happened to Count Fernan Gonzalez, and of
the answer he gave to his vassals.”</p>

<p>“On one occasion, Count Lucanor came from a foray, much wearied and
worn, and poorly off; and before he could refresh or rest himself,
there came a sudden message about another matter then newly moved. And
the greater part of his people counselled him, that he should refresh
himself a little, and then do whatever should be thought most wise. And
the Count asked Patronio what he should do in that matter; and Patronio
replied, ‘Sire, that you may choose what is best, it would please me
that you should know the answer which Count Fernan Gonzalez once gave
to his vassals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span>“‘The story.—Count
Fernan Gonzalez conquered Almanzor in Hazinas,<a id="FNanchor_114"
href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> but many of his people
fell there, and he and the rest that remained alive were sorely
wounded. And before they were sound and well, he heard that the king
of Navarre had broken into his lands, and so he commanded his people
to make ready to fight against them of Navarre. And all his people
told him, that their horses were aweary, and that they were aweary
themselves; and although for this cause they might not forsake this
thing, yet that, since both he and his people were sore wounded, they
ought to leave it, and that he ought to wait till he and they should be
sound again. And when the Count saw that they all wanted to leave that
road, then his honor grieved him more than his body, and he said, “My
friends, let us not shun this battle on account of the wounds that we
now have; for the fresh wounds they will presently give us will make
us forget those we received in the other fight.” And when they of his
party saw that he was not troubled concerning his own person, but only
how to defend his lands and his honor, they went with him, and they won
that battle, and things went right well afterwards.</p>

<p>“‘And you, my Lord Count Lucanor, if you desire to do what you
ought, when you see that it should be achieved for the defence of your
own rights and of your own people and of your own honor, then you must
not be grieved by weariness, nor by toil, nor by danger, but rather so
act that the new danger shall make you forget that which is past.’</p>

<p>“And the Count held this for a good history<a id="FNanchor_115"
href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> a good counsel; and he
acted accordingly, and found himself well by it. And Don John also
understood this to be a good history, and he had it written in this
book, and moreover made these verses, which say thus:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"> <p class="i0">“Hold this
for certain and for fact,</p> <p class="i0">For truth it is and
truth exact,</p> <p class="i0">That never Honor and Disgrace</p> <p
class="i0">Together sought a resting-place.”</p> </div></div>

<p>It is not easy to imagine any thing more simple and direct than
this story, either in the matter or the style. Others of the tales
have an air of more knightly dignity, and some have a little of the
gallantry that might be expected from a court like that of Alfonso
the Eleventh. In a very few of them, Don John gives intimations that
he had risen above the feelings and opinions of his age: as, in one,
he laughs at the monks and their pretensions;<a id="FNanchor_116"
href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> in another,
he introduces a pilgrim under no respectable circumstances;<a
id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
and in a third, he ridicules his uncle Alfonso for believing in
the follies of alchemy,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118"
class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and trusting a man who pretended to turn
the baser metals into gold. But in almost all we see the large
experience of a man of the world, as the world then existed, and the
cool observation of one who knew too much of mankind, and had suffered
too much from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span> them,
to have a great deal of the romance of youth still lingering in his
character. For we know, from himself, that Prince John wrote the Conde
Lucanor when he had already reached his highest honors and authority;
probably after he had passed through his severest defeats. It should
be remembered, therefore, to his credit, that we find in it no traces
of the arrogance of power, or of the bitterness of mortified ambition;
nothing of the wrongs he had suffered from others, and nothing of
those he had inflicted. It seems, indeed, to have been written in
some happy interval, stolen from the bustle of camps, the intrigues
of government, and the crimes of rebellion, when the experience of
his past life, its adventures, and its passions, were so remote as to
awaken little personal feeling, and yet so familiar that he could give
us their results, with great simplicity, in this series of tales and
anecdotes, which are marked with an originality that belongs to their
age, and with a kind of chivalrous philosophy and wise honesty that
would not be discreditable to one more advanced.<a id="FNanchor_119"

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reign of Alfonso the Eleventh was
full of troubles, and the unhappy monarch himself died at last of the
plague, while he was besieging Gibraltar, in 1350. Still, that letters
were not forgotten in it we know, not only from the example of Don John
Manuel, already cited, but from several others which should not be
passed over.</p>

<p>The first is a prose treatise on Hunting, in three books, written
under the king’s direction, by his Chief-huntsmen, who were then among
the principal persons of the court. It consists of little more than an
account of the sort of hounds to be used, their diseases and training,
with a description of the different places where game was abundant,
and where sport for the royal amusement was to be had. It is of small
consequence in itself, but was published by Argote de Molina, in the
time of Philip the Second, with a pleasant addition by the editor,
containing curious stories of lion-hunts and bull-fights, fitting it
to the taste of his own age. In style, the original work is as good
as the somewhat similar treatise of the Marquis of Villena,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span> on the Art of Carving,
written a hundred years later; and, from the nature of the subject,
it is more interesting.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The next literary monument attributed to this reign would be
important, if we had the whole of it. It is a chronicle, in the ballad
style, of events which happened in the time of Alfonso the Eleventh,
and commonly passes under his name. It was found, hidden in a mass
of Arabic manuscripts, by Diego de Mendoza, who attributed it, with
little ceremony, to “a secretary of the king”; and it was first
publicly made known by Argote de Molina, who thought it written by some
poet contemporary with the history he relates. But only thirty-four
stanzas of it are now known to exist; and these, though admitted by
Sanchez to be probably anterior to the fifteenth century, are shown
by him not to be the work of the king, and seem, in fact, to be less
ancient in style and language than that critic supposes them to be.<a
id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> They
are in very flowing Castilian, and their tone is as spirited as that of
most of the old ballads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>Two other poems,
written during the reign of one of the Alfonsos, as their author
declares,—and therefore almost certainly during that of Alfonso the
Eleventh, who was the last of his name,—are also now known in print
only by a few stanzas, and by the office of their writer, who styles
himself “a Beneficiary of Ubeda.” The first, which consists, in the
manuscript, of five hundred and five strophes in the manner of Berceo,
is a life of Saint Ildefonso; the last is on the subject of Saint
Mary Magdalen. Both would probably detain us little, even if they
had been published entire.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>We turn, therefore, without further delay, to Juan Ruiz, commonly
called the Archpriest of Hita; a poet who is known to have lived
at the same period, and whose works, both from their character and
amount, deserve especial notice. Their date can be ascertained<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span> with a good degree of
exactness. In one of the three early manuscripts in which they are
extant, some of the poems are fixed at the year 1330, and some, by
the two others, at 1343. Their author, who seems to have been born at
Alcalá de Henares, lived much at Guadalaxara and Hita, places only
five leagues apart, and was imprisoned by order of the Archbishop of
Toledo between 1337 and 1350; from all which it may be inferred, that
his principal residence was Castile, and that he flourished in the
reign of Alfonso the Eleventh; that is, in the time of Don John Manuel,
and a very little later.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>His works consist of nearly seven thousand verses; and although, in
general, they are written in the four-line stanza of Berceo, we find
occasionally a variety of measure, tone, and spirit, before unknown in
Castilian poetry; the number of their metrical forms, some of which
are taken from the Provençal, being reckoned not less than sixteen.<a
id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The
poems, as they have come to us, open with a prayer to God, composed
apparently at the time of the Archpriest’s imprisonment; when, as
one of the manuscripts sets forth, most of his works were written.<a
id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Next comes a curious prose prologue, explaining the moral purpose of
the whole collection, or rather endeavouring to conceal the immoral
tendency of the greater part of it. And then, after somewhat more of
prefatory matter, follow, in quick succession, the poems themselves,
very miscellaneous in their subjects, but ingeniously connected. The
entire mass, when taken together, fills a volume of respectable size.<a
id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span>It is a series of
stories, that seem to be sketches of real events in the Archpriest’s
own life; sometimes mingled with fictions and allegories, that may,
after all, be only veils for other facts; and sometimes speaking out
plainly, and announcing themselves as parts of his personal history.<a
id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> In
the foreground of this busy scene figures the very equivocal character
of his female messenger, the chief agent in his love affairs, whom he
boldly calls <i>Trota-conventos</i>, because the messages she carries are
so often to or from monasteries and nunneries.<a id="FNanchor_128"
href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The first lady-love to
whom the poet sends her is, he says, well taught,—<i>mucho letrada</i>,—and
her story is illustrated by the fables of the Sick Lion visited by
the other Animals, and of the Mountain bringing forth a Mouse. All,
however, is unavailing. The lady refuses to favor his suit; and he
consoles himself, as well as he can, with the saying of Solomon,
that all is vanity and vexation of spirit.<a id="FNanchor_129"
href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>In the next of his adventures, a false friend deceives him
and carries off his lady. But still he is not discouraged.<a
id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> He
feels himself to be drawn on by his fate, like the son of a Moorish
king, whose history he then relates; and, after some astrological
ruminations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> declares
himself to be born under the star of Venus, and inevitably subject to
her control. Another failure follows; and then Love comes in person to
visit him and counsels him in a series of fables, which are told with
great ease and spirit. The poet answers gravely. He is offended with
Don Amor for his falsehood, charges him with being guilty, either by
implication or directly, of all the seven deadly sins, and fortifies
each of his positions with an appropriate apologue.<a id="FNanchor_131"
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The Archpriest now goes to Doña Venus, who, though he knew Ovid,
is represented as the wife of Don Amor; and, taking counsel of her,
is successful. But the story he relates is evidently a fiction,
though it may be accommodated to the facts of the poet’s own case. It
is borrowed from a dialogue or play, written before the year 1300,
by Pamphylus Maurianus or Maurilianus, and long attributed to Ovid;
but the Castilian poet has successfully given to what he adopted
the coloring of his own national manners. All this portion, which
fills above a thousand lines, is somewhat free in its tone; and the
Archpriest, alarmed at himself, turns suddenly round and adds a series
of severe moral warnings and teachings to the sex, which he as suddenly
breaks off, and, without any assigned reason, goes to the mountains
near Segovia. But the month in which he makes his journey is March;
the season is rough; and several of his adventures are any thing but
agreeable. Still he preserves the same light and thoughtless air;
and this part of his history is mingled with spirited pastoral songs
in the Provençal manner, called “Cántigas de<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> Serrana,” as the preceding portions had
been mingled with fables, which he calls “Enxiemplos,” or stories.<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>A shrine, much frequented by the devout, is near that part of
the Sierra where his journeyings lay; and he makes a pilgrimage to
it, which he illustrates with sacred hymns, just as he had before
illustrated his love-adventures with apologues and songs. But Lent
approaches, and he hurries home. He is hardly arrived, however,
when he receives a summons in form from Doña Quaresma (Madam Lent)
to attend her in arms, with all her other archpriests and clergy,
in order to make a foray, like a foray into the territory of
the Moors, against Don Carnaval and his adherents. One of these
allegorical battles, which were in great favor with the Trouveurs
and other metre-mongers of the Middle Ages, then follows, in which
figure Don Tocino (Mr. Bacon) and Doña Cecina (Mrs. Hung-Beef),
with other similar personages. The result, of course, since it
is now the season of Lent, is the defeat and imprisonment of Don
Carnaval; but when that season closes, the allegorical prisoner
necessarily escapes, and, raising anew such followers as Mr. Lunch
and Mr. Breakfast, again takes the field, and is again triumphant.<a
id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span></p>

<p>Don Carnaval now unites himself to Don Amor, and both appear in
state as emperors. Don Amor is received with especial jubilee; clergy
and laity, friars, nuns, and <i>jongleurs</i>, going out in wild procession
to meet and welcome him.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a> But the honor of formally receiving his
Majesty, though claimed by all, and foremost by the nuns, is granted
only to the poet. To the poet, too, Don Amor relates his adventures of
the preceding winter at Seville and Toledo, and then leaves him to go
in search of others. Meanwhile, the Archpriest, with the assistance
of his cunning agent, <i>Trota-conventos</i>, begins a new series of love
intrigues, even more freely mingled with fables than the first, and
ends them only by the death of Trota-conventos herself, with whose
epitaph the more carefully connected portion of the Archpriest’s works
is brought to a conclusion. The volume contains, however, besides this
portion, several smaller poems on subjects as widely different as the
“Christian’s Armour” and the “Praise of Little Women,” some of which
seem related to the main series, though none of them have any apparent
connection with each other.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The tone of the Archpriest’s poetry is very various. In general,
a satirical spirit prevails in it, not unmingled with a quiet humor.
This spirit often extends into the gravest portions; and how fearless
he was, when he indulged himself in it, a passage on the influence
of money and corruption at the court of Rome leaves no doubt.<a
id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Other parts, like the verses on Death, are<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span> solemn, and even sometimes tender; while
yet others, like the hymns to the Madonna, breathe the purest spirit of
Catholic devotion; so that, perhaps, it would not be easy, in the whole
body of Spanish literature, to find a volume showing a greater variety
in its subjects, or in the modes of managing and exhibiting them.<a
id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The happiest success of the Archpriest of Hita is to be found in
the many tales and apologues which he has scattered on all sides to
illustrate the adventures that constitute a framework for his poetry,
like that of the “Conde Lucanor” or the “Canterbury Tales.” Most of
them are familiar to us, being taken from the old store-houses of
Æsop and Phædrus, or rather from the versions of these fabulists
common in the earliest Northern French poetry.<a id="FNanchor_138"
href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Among the more
fortunate of his very free imitations is the fable of the Frogs
who asked for a King from Jupiter, that of the Dog who lost by his
Greediness the Meat he carried in his Mouth, and that of the Hares who
took Courage when they saw the Frogs were more timid than themselves.<a
id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> A
few of them have a truth, a simplicity, and even<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span> a grace, which have rarely been surpassed
in the same form of composition; as, for instance, that of the
City Mouse and the Country Mouse, which, if we follow it from Æsop
through Horace to La Fontaine, we shall nowhere find better told than
it is by the Archpriest.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140"
class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>What strikes us most, however, and remains with us longest after
reading his poetry, is the natural and spirited tone that prevails
over every other. In this he is like Chaucer, who wrote a little later
in the same century. Indeed, the resemblance between the two poets is
remarkable in some other particulars. Both often sought their materials
in the Northern French poetry; both have that mixture of devotion and
a licentious immorality, much of which belonged to their age, but some
of it to their personal character; and both show a wide knowledge
of human nature, and a great happiness in sketching the details of
individual manners. The original temper of each made him satirical
and humorous; and each, in his own country, became the founder of
some of the forms of its popular poetry, introducing new metres and
combinations, and carrying them out in a versification which, though
generally rude and irregular, is often flowing and nervous, and always
natural. The Archpriest has not, indeed, the tenderness, the elevation,
or the general power of Chaucer; but his genius has a compass, and his
verse a skill and success, that show him to be more nearly akin to
the great English master than will be believed,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> except by those who have carefully read the
works of both.</p>

<p>The Archpriest of Hita lived in the last years of Alfonso the
Eleventh, and perhaps somewhat later. At the very beginning of the next
reign, or in 1350, we find a curious poem addressed by a Jew of Carrion
to Peter the Cruel, on his accession to the throne. In the manuscript
found in the National Library at Madrid, it is called the “Book of the
Rabi de Santob,” or “Rabbi Don Santob,” and consists of four hundred
and seventy-six stanzas.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141"
class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The measure is the old <i>redondilla</i>,
uncommonly easy and flowing for the age; and the purpose of the poem is
to give wise moral counsels to the new king, which the poet more than
once begs him not to undervalue because they come from a Jew.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Because upon a thorn it grows,</p>
<p class="i2">The rose is not less fair;</p>
<p class="i0">And wine that from the vine-stock flows</p>
<p class="i2">Still flows untainted there.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>The goshawk, too, will proudly soar,</p>
<p class="i2">Although his nest sits low;</p>
<p class="i0">And gentle teachings have their power,</p>
<p class="i2">Though ’t is the Jew says so.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>After a longer introduction than is needful, the moral counsels
begin, at the fifty-third stanza, and continue through the rest of the
work, which, in its general tone, is not unlike other didactic poetry
of the period, although it is written with more ease and more poetical
spirit. Indeed, it is little to say, that few Rabbins of any country
have given us such quaint and pleasant verses as are contained in
several parts of these curious counsels of the Jew of Carrion.</p>

<p>In the Escurial manuscript, containing the verses of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span> the Jew, are other
poems, which were at one time attributed to him, but which it seems
probable belong to other, though unknown, authors.<a id="FNanchor_143"
href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> One of them is a
didactic essay, called “La Doctrina Christiana,” or Christian Doctrine.
It consists of a prose prologue, setting forth the writer’s penitence,
and of one hundred and fifty-seven stanzas of four lines each; the
first three containing eight syllables, rhymed together, and the
last containing four syllables unrhymed,—a metrical form not without
something of the air of the Sapphic and Adonic. The body of the work
contains an explanation of the creed, the ten commandments, the seven
moral virtues, the fourteen works of mercy, the seven deadly sins,
the five senses, and the holy sacraments, with discussions concerning
Christian conduct and character.</p>

<p>Another of these poems is called a Revelation, and is a vision, in
twenty-five octave stanzas, of a holy hermit, who is supposed to have
witnessed a contest between a soul and its body; the soul complaining
that the excesses of the body had brought upon it all the punishments
of the unseen world, and the body retort<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span>ing, that it was condemned to these same
torments because the soul had neglected to keep it in due subjection.<a
id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The
whole is an imitation of some of the many similar poems current at that
period, one of which is extant in English in a manuscript placed by
Warton about the year 1304.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145"
class="fnanchor">[145]</a> But both the Castilian poems are of little
worth.</p>

<p>We come, then, to one of more value, “La Dança General,” or the
Dance of Death, consisting of seventy-nine regular octave stanzas,
preceded by a few words of introduction in prose, that do not seem
to be by the same author.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It is founded on the well-known fiction, so
often illustrated both in painting and in verse during the Middle Ages,
that all men, of all conditions, are summoned to the Dance of Death; a
kind of spiritual masquerade, in which the different ranks of society,
from the Pope to the young child, appear dancing with the skeleton form
of Death. In this Spanish version it is striking and picturesque,—more
so, perhaps, than in any other,—the ghastly nature of the subject
being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> brought
into a very lively contrast with the festive tone of the verses,
which frequently recalls some of the better parts of those flowing
stories that now and then occur in the “Mirror for Magistrates.”<a
id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The first seven stanzas of the Spanish poem constitute a prologue,
in which Death issues his summons partly in his own person, and partly
in that of a preaching friar, ending thus:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Come to the Dance of Death, all ye whose fate</p>
<p class="i2">By birth is mortal, be ye great or small;</p>
<p class="i0">And willing come, nor loitering, nor late,</p>
<p class="i2">Else force shall bring you struggling to my thrall:</p>
<p class="i2">For since yon friar hath uttered loud his call</p>
<p class="i0">To penitence and godliness sincere,</p>
<p class="i0">He that delays must hope no waiting here;</p>
<p class="i2">For still the cry is, Haste! and, Haste to all!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Death now proceeds, as in the old pictures and poems, to summon,
first, the Pope, then cardinals, kings, bishops, and so on, down to
day-laborers; all of whom are forced to join his mortal dance, though
each first makes some remonstrance, that indicates surprise, horror, or
reluctance. The call to youth and beauty is spirited:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Bring to my dance, and bring without delay,</p>
<p class="i2">Those damsels twain, you see so bright and fair;</p>
<p class="i0">They came, but came not in a willing way,</p>
<p class="i2">To list my chants of mortal grief and care:</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>Nor shall the flowers and roses fresh they wear,</p>
<p class="i0">Nor rich attire, avail their forms to save.</p>
<p class="i0">They strive in vain who strive against the grave;</p>
<p class="i2">It may not be; my wedded brides they are.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>The fiction is, no doubt, a grim one; but for several centuries
it had great success throughout Europe, and it is presented quite as
much according to its true spirit in this old Castilian poem as it is
anywhere.</p>

<p>A chronicling poem, found in the same manuscript volume with
the last, but very unskilfully copied in a different handwriting,
belongs probably to the same period. It is on the half-fabulous,
half-historical achievements of Count Fernan Gonzalez, a hero of the
earlier period of the Christian conflict with the Moors, who is to
the North of Spain what the Cid became somewhat later to Aragon and
Valencia. To him is attributed the rescue of much of Castile from
Mohammedan control; and his achievements, so far as they are matter
of historical rather than poetical record, fall between 934, when the
battle of Osma was fought, and his death, which occurred in 970.</p>

<p>The poem in question is almost wholly devoted to his glory.<a
id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
It begins with a notice of the invasion<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> of Spain by the Goths, and comes down to
the battle of Moret, in 967, when the manuscript suddenly breaks off,
leaving untouched the adventures of its hero during the three remaining
years of his life. It is essentially prosaic and monotonous in its
style, yet not without something of that freshness and simplicity
which are in themselves allied to all early poetry. Its language is
rude, and its measure, which strives to be like that in Berceo and
the poem of Apollonius, is often in stanzas of three lines instead
of four, sometimes of five, and once at least of nine. Like Berceo’s
poem on San Domingo de Silos, it opens with an invocation, and, what
is singular, this invocation is in the very words used by Berceo:
“In the name of the Father, who made all things,” etc. After this,
the history, beginning in the days of the Goths, follows the popular
traditions of the country, with few exceptions, the most remarkable of
which occurs in the notice of the Moorish invasion. There the account
is quite anomalous. No intimation is given of the story of the fair
Cava, whose fate has furnished materials for so much poetry; but
Count Julian is represented as having, without any private injury,
volunteered his treason to the king of Morocco, and then carried it
into effect by persuading Don Roderic, in full Cortes, to turn all the
military weapons of the land into implements of agriculture, so that,
when the Moorish invasion occurred, the country was overrun without
difficulty.</p>

<p>The death of the Count of Toulouse, on the other<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> hand, is described as it is
in the “General Chronicle” of Alfonso the Wise; and so are the vision
of Saint Millan, and the Count’s personal fights with a Moorish king
and the King of Navarre. In truth, many passages in the poem so much
resemble the corresponding passages in the Chronicle, that it seems
certain one was used in the composition of the other; and as the poem
has more the air of being an amplification of the Chronicle than the
Chronicle has of being an abridgment of the poem, it seems probable
that the prose account is, in this case, the older, and furnished the
materials of the poem, which, from internal evidence, was prepared
for public recitation.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The meeting of Fernan Gonzalez with the King of Navarre at the
battle of Valparé, which occurs in both, is thus described in the
poem:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And now the King and Count were met · together in the fight,</p>
<p class="i0">And each against the other turned · the utmost of his might,</p>
<p class="i0">Beginning there a battle fierce · in furious despite.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And never fight was seen more brave, · nor champions more true;</p>
<p class="i0">For to rise or fall for once and all · they fought, as well they knew;</p>
<p class="i0">And neither, as each inly felt, · a greater deed could do;</p>
<p class="i0">So they struck and strove right manfully, · with blows nor light nor few.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">Ay, mighty was that fight indeed, · and mightier still about</p>
<p class="i0">The din that rose like thunder · round those champions brave and stout:</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span>A man with all his voice might cry · and none would heed his shout;</p>
<p class="i0">For he that listened could not hear, · amidst such rush and rout.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">The blows they struck were heavy; · heavier blows there could not be;</p>
<p class="i0">On both sides, to the uttermost, · they struggled manfully,</p>
<p class="i0">And many, that ne’er rose again, · bent to the earth the knee,</p>
<p class="i0">And streams of blood o’erspread the ground, · as on all sides you might see.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And knights were there, from good Navarre, · both numerous and bold,</p>
<p class="i0">Whom everywhere for brave and strong · true gentlemen would hold;</p>
<p class="i0">But still against the good Count’s might · their strength proved weak and cold,</p>
<p class="i0">Though men of great emprise before · and fortune manifold.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">For God’s good grace still kept the Count · from sorrow and from harm,</p>
<p class="i0">That neither Moor nor Christian power · should stand against his arm, etc.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>This is certainly not poetry of a high order. Invention and
dignified ornament are wanting in it; but still it is not without
spirit, and, at any rate, it would be difficult to find in the whole
poem a passage more worthy of regard.</p>

<p>In the National Library at Madrid is a poem of twelve hundred and
twenty lines, composed in the same system of quaternion rhymes that
we have already noticed as settled in the old Castilian literature,
and with irregularities like those found in the whole class of poems
to which it belongs. Its subject is Joseph, the son of Jacob; but
there are two circumstances which distinguish it from all the other
narrative poetry of the period, and render it curious and important.
The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span> is, that,
though composed in the Spanish language, it is written wholly in the
Arabic character, and has, therefore, all the appearance of an Arabic
manuscript; to which should be added the fact, that the metre and
spelling are accommodated to the force of the Arabic vowels, so that,
if the only manuscript of it now known to exist be not the original,
it must still have been originally written in the same manner. The
other singular circumstance is, that the story of the poem, which is
the familiar one of Joseph and his brethren, is not told according to
the original in our Hebrew Scriptures, but according to the shorter
and less interesting version in the eleventh chapter of the Koran,
with occasional variations and additions, some of which are due to
the fanciful expounders of the Koran, while others seem to be of the
author’s own invention. These two circumstances taken together leave
no reasonable doubt that the writer of the poem was one of the many
Moriscos who, remaining at the North after the body of the nation
had been driven southward, had forgotten their native language and
adopted that of their conquerors, though their religion and culture
still continued to be Arabic.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152"
class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The manuscript of the “Poem of Joseph” is imperfect, both at
the beginning and at the end. Not much of it, however, seems to be
lost. It opens with the jealousy of the brothers of Joseph at his
dream, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span> their
solicitation of their father to let him go with them to the field.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then up and spake his sons: · “Sire, do not deem it so;</p>
<p class="i0">Ten brethren are we here, · this very well you know;—</p>
<p class="i0">That we should all be traitors, · and treat him as a foe,</p>
<p class="i0">You either will not fear, · or you will not let him go.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">“But this is what we thought, · as our Maker knows above:</p>
<p class="i0">That the child might gain more knowledge, · and with it gain our love,</p>
<p class="i0">To show him all our shepherd’s craft, · as with flocks and herds we move;—</p>
<p class="i0">But still the power is thine to grant, · and thine to disapprove.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And then they said so much · with words so smooth and fair,</p>
<p class="i0">And promised him so faithfully · with words of pious care,</p>
<p class="i0">That he gave them up his child; · but bade them first beware,</p>
<p class="i0">And bring him quickly back again, · unharmed by any snare.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>When the brothers have consummated their treason, and sold Joseph to
a caravan of Egyptian merchants, the story goes on much as it does in
the Koran. The fair Zuleikha, or Zuleia, who answers to Potiphar’s wife
in the Hebrew Scriptures, and who figures largely in Mohammedan poetry,
fills a space more ample than usual in the fancies of the present poem.
Joseph, too, is a more considerable personage. He is adopted as the
king’s son, and made a king in the land; and the dreams of the real
king, the years of plenty and famine, the journeyings of the brothers
to Egypt, their recognition by Joseph, and his message to Jacob, with
the grief of the latter that Benjamin did not return, at which the
manuscript breaks off, are much amplified, in the Oriental manner, and
made to sound like passages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p.
97]</span> from “Antar,” or the “Arabian Nights,” rather than from the
touching and beautiful story to which we have been accustomed from our
childhood.</p>

<p>Among the inventions of the author is a conversation which
the wolf—who is brought in by his false brethren, as the animal
that had killed Joseph—holds with Jacob.<a id="FNanchor_154"
href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Another is the
Eastern fancy, that the measure by which Joseph distributed the
corn, and which was made of gold and precious stones, would, when
put to his ear, inform him whether the persons present were guilty
of falsehood to him.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a> But the following incident, which,
like that of Joseph’s parting in a spirit of tender forgiveness
from his brethren<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156"
class="fnanchor">[156]</a> when they sold him, is added to the
narrative of the Koran, will better illustrate the general tone of the
poem, as well as the general powers of the poet.</p>

<p>On the first night after the outrage, Jusuf, as he is called in the
poem, when travelling along in charge of a negro, passes a cemetery on
a hill-side where his mother lies buried.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And when the negro heeded not, · that guarded him behind,</p>
<p class="i0">From off the camel Jusuf sprang, · on which he rode confined,</p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span>
<p class="i0">And hastened, with all speed, · his mother’s grave to find,</p>
<p class="i0">Where he knelt and pardon sought, · to relieve his troubled mind.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">He cried, “God’s grace be with thee still, · O Lady mother dear!</p>
<p class="i0">O mother, you would sorrow, · if you looked upon me here;</p>
<p class="i0">For my neck is bound with chains, · and I live in grief and fear,</p>
<p class="i0">Like a traitor by my brethren sold, · like a captive to the spear.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">“They have sold me! they have sold me! · though I never did them harm;</p>
<p class="i0">They have torn me from my father, · from his strong and living arm,</p>
<p class="i0">By art and cunning they enticed me, · and by falsehood’s guilty charm,</p>
<p class="i0">And I go a base-bought captive, · full of sorrow and alarm.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">But now the negro looked about, · and knew that he was gone,</p>
<p class="i0">For no man could be seen, · and the camel came alone;</p>
<p class="i0">So he turned his sharpened ear, · and caught the wailing tone,</p>
<p class="i0">Where Jusuf, by his mother’s grave, · lay making heavy moan.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And the negro hurried up, · and gave him there a blow;</p>
<p class="i0">So quick and cruel was it, · that it instant laid him low;</p>
<p class="i0">“A base-born wretch,” he cried aloud, · “a base-born thief art thou;</p>
<p class="i0">Thy masters, when we purchased thee, · they told us it was so.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">But Jusuf answered straight, · “Nor thief nor wretch am I;</p>
<p class="i0">My mother’s grave is this, · and for pardon here I cry;</p>
<p class="i0">I cry to Allah’s power, · and send my prayer on high,</p>
<p class="i0">That, since I never wronged thee, · his curse may on thee lie.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And then all night they travelled on, · till dawned the coming day,</p>
<p class="i0">When the land was sore tormented · with a whirlwind’s furious sway;</p>
<p class="i0">The sun grew dark at noon, · their hearts sunk in dismay,</p>
<p class="i0">And they knew not, with their merchandise, · to seek or make their way.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span>The age and
origin of this remarkable poem can be settled only by internal
evidence. From this it seems probable that it was written in Aragon,
because it contains many words and phrases peculiar to the border
country of the Provençals,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158"
class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and that it dates from the latter half of
the fourteenth century, because the four-fold rhyme is hardly found
later in such verses, and because the rudeness of the language might
indicate even an earlier period, if the tale had come from Castile. But
in whatever period we may place it, it is a curious and interesting
production. It has the directness and simplicity of the age to which
it is attributed, mingled sometimes with a tenderness rarely found
in ages so violent. Its pastoral air, too, and its preservation of
Oriental manners, harmonize well with the Arabian feelings that
prevail throughout the work; while in its spirit, and occasionally
in its moral tone, it shows the confusion of the two religions
which then prevailed in Spain, and that mixture of the Eastern and
Western forms of civilization which afterwards gives somewhat of its
coloring to Spanish poetry.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159"
class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The last poem belonging to these earliest specimens of Castilian
literature is the “Rimado de Palacio,” on the duties of kings and
nobles in the government of the state, with sketches of the manners and
vices of the times, which, as the poem maintains, it is the duty of
the great to rebuke and reform. It is chiefly written in the four-line
stanzas of the period to which it belongs; and, beginning with a
penitential confession of its author, goes on with a discussion of the
ten command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>ments,
the seven deadly sins, the seven works of mercy, and other religious
subjects; after which it treats of the government of a state, of royal
counsellors, of merchants, of men of learning, tax-gatherers, and
others; and then ends, as it began, with exercises of devotion. Its
author is Pedro Lopez de Ayala, the chronicler, of whom it is enough
to say here, that he was among the most distinguished Spaniards of
his time, that he held some of the highest offices of the kingdom
under Peter the Cruel, Henry the Second, John the First, and Henry
the Third, and that he died in 1407, at the age of seventy-five.<a
id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The “Rimado de Palacio,” which may be translated “Court Rhymes,” was
the production of different periods of Ayala’s life. Twice he marks the
year in which he was writing, and from these dates we know that parts
of it were certainly composed in 1398 and 1404, while yet another part
seems to have been written during his imprisonment in England, which
followed the defeat of Henry of Trastamara by the Duke of Lancaster, in
1367. On the whole, therefore, the Rimado de Palacio is to be placed
near the conclusion of the fourteenth century, and, by its author’s
sufferings in an English prison, reminds us both of the Duke of Orleans
and of James the First of Scotland, who, at the same time and under
similar circumstances, showed a poetical spirit not unlike that of the
great Chancellor of Castile.</p>

<p>In some of its subdivisions, particularly in those that have a
lyrical tendency, the Rimado resembles some of the lighter poems of
the Archpriest of Hita. Others are composed with care and gravity, and
express the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span> solemn
thoughts that filled him during his captivity. But, in general, it has
a quiet, didactic tone, such as beseems its subject and its age; one,
however, in which we occasionally find a satirical spirit that could
not be suppressed, when the old statesman discusses the manners that
offended him. Thus, speaking of the <i>Letrados</i>, or lawyers, he says:<a
id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">When entering on a lawsuit, · if you ask for their advice,</p>
<p class="i0">They sit down very solemnly, · their brows fall in a trice.</p>
<p class="i0">“A question grave is this,” they say, · “and asks for labor nice;</p>
<p class="i0">To the Council it must go, · and much management implies.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">“I think, perhaps, in time, · I can help you in the thing,</p>
<p class="i0">By dint of labor long · and grievous studying;</p>
<p class="i0">But other duties I must leave, · away all business fling,</p>
<p class="i0">Your case alone must study, · and to you alone must cling.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Somewhat farther on, when he speaks of justice, whose administration
had been so lamentably neglected in the civil wars during which
he lived, he takes his graver tone, and speaks with a wisdom and
gentleness we should hardly have expected:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">True justice is a noble thing, · that merits all renown;</p>
<p class="i0">It fills the land with people, · checks the guilty with its frown;</p>
<p class="i0">But kings, that should uphold its power, · in thoughtlessness look down,</p>
<p class="i0">And forget the precious jewel · that gems their honored crown.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And many think by cruelty · its duties to fulfil,</p>
<p class="i0">But their wisdom all is cunning, · for justice doth no ill;</p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span>
<p class="i0">With pity and with truth it dwells, · and faithful men will still</p>
<p class="i0">From punishment and pain turn back, · as sore against their will.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>There is naturally a good deal in the Rimado de Palacio that savors
of statesmanship; as, for instance, nearly all that relates to royal
favorites, to war, and to the manners of the palace; but the general
air of the poem, or rather of the different short poems that make it
up, is fairly represented in the preceding passages. It is grave,
gentle, and didactic, with now and then a few lines of a simple and
earnest poetical feeling, which seem to belong quite as much to their
age as to their author.</p>


<p class="mt2">We have now gone over a considerable portion of the
earliest Castilian literature, and quite completed an examination of
that part of it which, at first epic, and afterwards didactic, in its
tone, is found in long, irregular verses, with quadruple rhymes. It is
all curious. Much of it is picturesque and interesting; and when, to
what has been already examined, we shall have added the ballads and
chronicles, the romances of chivalry and the drama, the whole will
be found to constitute a broad basis, on which the genuine literary
culture of Spain has rested ever since.</p>

<p>But, before we go farther, we must pause an instant, and notice
some of the peculiarities of the period we have just considered. It
extends from a little before the year 1200 to a little after the year
1400; and, both in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>
its poetry and prose, is marked by features not to be mistaken. Some
of these features were peculiar and national; others were not. Thus,
in Provence, which was long united with Aragon, and exercised an
influence throughout the whole Peninsula, the popular poetry, from its
light-heartedness, was called the <i>Gaya Sciencia</i>, and was essentially
unlike the grave and measured tone, heard over every other, on the
Spanish side of the mountains; in the more northern parts of France,
a garrulous, story-telling spirit was paramount; and in Italy, Dante,
Petrarca, and Boccaccio had just appeared, unlike all that had preceded
them, and all that was anywhere contemporary with their glory. On the
other hand, however, several of the characteristics of the earliest
Castilian literature, such as the chronicling and didactic spirit of
most of its long poems, its protracted, irregular verses, and its
redoubled rhymes, belong to the old Spanish bards in common with those
of the countries we have just enumerated, where, at the same period,
a poetical spirit was struggling for a place in the elements of their
unsettled civilization.</p>

<p>But there are two traits of the earliest Spanish literature which
are so separate and peculiar, that they must be noticed from the
outset,—religious faith and knightly loyalty,—traits which are hardly
less apparent in the “Partidas” of Alfonso the Wise, in the stories of
Don John Manuel, in the loose wit of the Archpriest of Hita, and in the
worldly wisdom of the Chancellor Ayala, than in the professedly devout
poems of Berceo and in the professedly chivalrous chronicles of the Cid
and Fernan Gonzalez. They are, therefore, from the earliest period, to
be marked among the prominent features in Spanish literature.</p>

<p>Nor should we be surprised at this. The Spanish<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span> national character, as
it has existed from its first development down to our own days, was
mainly formed in the earlier part of that solemn contest which began
the moment the Moors landed beneath the Rock of Gibraltar, and which
cannot be said to have ended, until, in the time of Philip the Third,
the last remnants of their unhappy race were cruelly driven from the
shores which their fathers, nine centuries before, had so unjustifiably
invaded. During this contest, and especially during the two or three
dark centuries when the earliest Spanish poetry appeared, nothing
but an invincible religious faith, and a no less invincible loyalty
to their own princes, could have sustained the Christian Spaniards
in their disheartening struggle against their infidel oppressors. It
was, therefore, a stern necessity which made these two high qualities
elements of the Spanish national character,—a character all whose
energies were for ages devoted to the one grand object of their prayers
as Christians and their hopes as patriots, the expulsion of their hated
invaders.</p>

<p>But Castilian poetry was, from the first, to an extraordinary
degree, an outpouring of the popular feeling and character. Tokens
of religious submission and knightly fidelity, akin to each other in
their birth and often relying on each other for strength in their
trials, are, therefore, among its earliest attributes. We must not,
then, be surprised, if we hereafter find, that submission to the Church
and loyalty to the king constantly break through the mass of Spanish
literature, and breathe their spirit from nearly every portion of
it,—not, indeed, without such changes in the mode of expression as
the changed condition of the country in successive ages demanded, but
still always so strong in their original attributes as to show that
they survive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span> every
convulsion of the state and never cease to move onward by their first
impulse. In truth, while their very early development leaves no doubt
that they are national, their nationality makes it all but inevitable
that they should become permanent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everywhere</span> in Europe, during the period
we have just gone over, the courts of the different sovereigns were
the principal centres of refinement and civilization. From accidental
circumstances, this was peculiarly the case in Spain, during the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. On the throne of Castile, or
within its shadow, we have seen a succession of such poets and
prose-writers as Alfonso the Wise, Sancho, his son, Don John Manuel,
his nephew, and the Chancellor Ayala, to say nothing of Saint
Ferdinand, who preceded them all, and who, perhaps, gave the first
decisive impulse to letters in the centre of Spain and at the North.<a
id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>But the literature produced or encouraged by these<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span> and other distinguished
men, or by the higher clergy, who, with them, were the leaders of the
state, was by no means the only literature that then existed within the
barrier of the Pyrenees. On the contrary, the spirit of poetry was,
to an extraordinary degree, abroad throughout the whole Peninsula, so
far as it had been rescued from the Moors, animating and elevating all
classes of its Christian population. Their own romantic history, whose
great events had been singularly the results of popular impulse, and
bore everywhere the bold impress of the popular character, had breathed
into the Spanish people this spirit; a spirit which, beginning with
Pelayo, had been sustained by the appearance, from time to time, of
such heroic forms as Fernan Gonzalez, Bernardo del Carpio, and the Cid.
At the point of time, therefore, at which we are now arrived, a more
popular literature, growing directly out of the enthusiasm which had so
long pervaded the whole mass of the Spanish people, began naturally to
appear in the country, and to assert for itself a place, which, in some
of its forms, it has successfully maintained ever since.</p>

<p>What, however, is thus essentially popular in its sources and
character,—what, instead of going out from the more elevated classes
of the nation, was neglected or discountenanced by them,—is, from its
very wildness, little likely to take well-defined forms, or to be
traced, from its origin, by the dates and other proofs which accompany
such portions of the national literature as fell earlier under the
protection of the higher orders of society. But though we may not be
able to make out an exact arrangement or a detailed history of what
was necessarily so free and always so little watched, it can still
be distributed into four different classes,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span> and will afford tolerable materials for a
notice of its progress and condition under each.</p>

<p>These four classes are, first, the <span
class="smcap">Ballads</span>, or the poetry, both narrative and
lyrical, of the common people, from the earliest times; second,
the <span class="smcap">Chronicles</span>, or the half-genuine,
half-fabulous histories of the great events and heroes of the national
annals, which, though originally begun by authority of the state,
were always deeply imbued with the popular feelings and character;
third, the <span class="smcap">Romances of Chivalry</span>, intimately
connected with both the others, and, after a time, as passionately
admired as either by the whole nation; and, fourth, the <span
class="smcap">Drama</span>, which, in its origin, has always been a
popular and religious amusement, and was hardly less so in Spain than
it was in Greece or in France.</p>

<p>These four classes compose what was generally most valued in Spanish
literature during the latter part of the fourteenth century, the whole
of the fifteenth, and much of the sixteenth. They rested on the deep
foundations of the national character, and therefore, by their very
nature, were opposed to the Provençal, the Italian, and the courtly
schools, which flourished during the same period, and which will be
subsequently examined.</p>


<p class="mt2"><span class="smcap">The Ballads.</span>—We begin
with the ballads, because it cannot reasonably be doubted that
poetry, in the present Spanish language, appeared earliest in the
ballad form. And the first question that occurs in relation to them
is the obvious one, why this was the case. It has been suggested,
in reply, that there was probably a tendency to this most popular
form of composition in Spain at an age even much more remote than
that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span> the
origin of the present Spanish language itself;<a id="FNanchor_165"
href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> that such a tendency
may, perhaps, be traced back to those indigenous bards of whom only a
doubtful tradition remained in the time of Strabo;<a id="FNanchor_166"
href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and that it may be
seen to emerge again in the Leonine and other rhymed Latin verses
of the Gothic period,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a> or in that more ancient and obscure Basque
poetry, of which the little that has been preserved to us is thought to
breathe a spirit countenancing such conjectures.<a id="FNanchor_168"
href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> But these and similar
suggestions have so slight a foundation in recorded facts, that they
can be little relied on. The one more frequently advanced is, that
the Spanish ballads, such as we now have them, are imitations from
the narrative and lyrical poetry of the Arabs, with which the whole
southern part of Spain for ages resounded; and that, in fact, the
very form in which Spanish ballads still appear is Arabic, and is to
be traced to the Arabs in the East, at a period not only anterior to
the invasion of Spain, but anterior to the age of the Prophet. This
is the theory of Conde.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169"
class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>But though,
from the air of historical pretension with which it presents itself,
there is something in this theory that bespeaks our favor, yet there
are strong reasons that forbid our assent to it. For the earliest of
the Spanish ballads, concerning which alone the question can arise,
have not at all the characteristics of an imitated literature. Not a
single Arabic original has been found for any one of them; nor, so
far as we know, has a single passage of Arabic poetry, or a single
phrase from any Arabic writer, entered directly into their composition.
On the contrary, their freedom, their energy, their Christian tone
and chivalrous loyalty, announce an originality and independence of
character that prevent us from believing they could have been in any
way materially indebted to the brilliant, but effeminate, literature
of the nation to whose spirit every thing Spanish had, when they first
appeared, been for ages implacably opposed. It seems, therefore, that
they must, of their own nature, be as original as any poetry of modern
times; containing, as they do, within themselves proofs that they are
Spanish by their birth, natives of the soil, and stained with all its
variations. For a long time, too, subsequent to that of their first
appearance, they continued to exhibit the same elements of nationality;
so that, until we approach the fall of Granada, we find in them neither
a Moorish tone, nor Moorish subjects, nor Moorish adventures; nothing,
in short, to justify us in supposing them to have been more indebted
to the culture of the Arabs than was any other portion of the early
Spanish literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>Indeed, it does
not seem reasonable to seek, in the East or elsewhere, a foreign origin
for the mere <i>form</i> of the Spanish ballads. Their metrical structure is
so simple, that we can readily believe it to have presented itself as
soon as verse of any sort was felt to be a popular want. They consist
merely of those eight-syllable lines which are composed with great
facility in other languages as well as the Castilian, and which in the
old ballads are the more easy, as the number of feet prescribed for
each verse is little regarded.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Sometimes, though rarely, they are broken
into stanzas of four lines, thence called <i>redondillas</i> or roundelays;
and some of them have rhymes in the second and fourth lines of each
stanza, or in the first and fourth, as in the similar stanzas of
other modern languages. Their prominent peculiarity, however, and one
which they have succeeded in impressing upon a very large portion of
all the national poetry, is one which, being found to prevail<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span> in no other literature,
may be claimed to have its origin in Spain, and becomes, therefore, an
important circumstance in the history of Spanish poetical culture.<a
id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p id="asonante">The peculiarity to which we refer is that of
the <i>asonante</i>,—an imperfect rhyme confined to the vowels, and
beginning with the last accented one in the line; so that it
embraces sometimes only the very last syllable, and sometimes
goes back to the penultimate or even the antepenultimate. It is
contradistinguished from the <i>consonante</i>, or full rhyme, which is
made both by the consonants and vowels in the concluding syllable
or syllables of the line, and which is, therefore, just what
<i>rhyme</i> is in English.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Thus, <i>feróz</i> and <i>furór</i>, <i>cása</i> and
<i>abárca</i>, <i>infámia</i> and <i>contrária</i>, are good <i>asonantes</i> in the
first and third ballads of the Cid, just as <i>mál</i> and <i>desleál</i>,
<i>voláre</i> and <i>caçáre</i>, are good <i>consonantes</i> in the old ballad
of the Marquis of Mantua, cited by Don Quixote. The <i>asonante</i>,
therefore, is something be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p.
113]</span>tween our blank verse and our rhyme, and the art of using
it is easily acquired in a language like the Castilian, abounding
in vowels, and always giving to the same vowel the same value.<a
id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
In the old ballads, it generally recurs with every other line; and,
from the facility with which it can be found, the same <i>asonante</i>
is frequently continued through the whole of the poem in which it
occurs, whether the poem be longer or shorter. But even with this
embarrassment, the structure of the ballad is so simple, that,
while Sarmiento has undertaken to show how Spanish prose from
the twelfth century downwards is often written unconsciously in
eight-syllable <i>asonantes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"
class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Sepúlveda in the sixteenth century
actually converted large portions of the old chronicles into the same
ballad measure, with little change of their original phraseology;<a
id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> two
circumstances which, taken together, show indisputably that there can
be no wide interval between the common structure of Spanish prose
and this earliest form of Spanish verse. If to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> all this we add the national
recitatives in which the ballads have been sung down to our own
days, and the national dances by which they have been accompanied,<a
id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> we
shall probably be persuaded, not only that the form of the Spanish
ballad is as purely national in its origin as the <i>asonante</i>,
which is its prominent characteristic, but that this form is more
happily fitted to its especial purposes, and more easy in its
practical application to them, than any other into which popular
poetry has fallen in ancient or modern times.<a id="FNanchor_177"
href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>A metrical form so natural and obvious became a favorite at
once, and continued so. From the ballads it soon passed into other
departments of the national poetry, especially the lyrical. At a later
period, the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>
mass of the true Spanish drama came to rest upon it; and before the
end of the seventeenth century more verses had probably been written
in it than in all the other measures used by Spanish poets. Lope de
Vega declared it to be fitted for all styles of composition, even the
gravest; and his judgment was sanctioned in his own time, and has
been justified in ours, by the application of this peculiar form of
verse to long epic stories.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178"
class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The eight-syllable <i>asonante</i>, therefore,
may be considered as now known and used in every department of Spanish
poetry; and since it has, from the first, been a chief element in that
poetry, we may well believe it will continue such as long as what is
most original in the national genius continues to be cultivated.</p>

<p>Some of the ballads embodied in this genuinely Castilian measure
are, no doubt, very ancient. That such ballads existed in the
earliest times, their very name, <i>Romances</i>, may intimate; since
it seems to imply that they were, at some period, the only poetry
known in the <i>Romance</i> language of Spain; and such a period can have
been no other than the one immediately following the formation of
the language itself. Popular poetry of some sort—and more probably
ballad poetry than any other—was sung concerning the achievements of
the Cid as early as 1147.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a> A century later than this,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span> but earlier than the
prose of the “Fuero Juzgo,” Saint Ferdinand, after the capture of
Seville in 1248, gave allotments or <i>repartimientos</i> to two poets
who had been with him during the siege, Nicolas <i>de los Romances</i>,
and Domingo Abad <i>de los Romances</i>, the first of whom continued
for some time afterwards to inhabit the rescued city and exercise
his vocation as a poet.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"
class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In the next reign, or between 1252 and
1280, such poets are again mentioned. A <i>joglaressa</i>, or female
ballad-singer, is introduced into the poem of “Apollonius,” which
is supposed to have been written soon after the year 1250;<a
id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
and in the Code of Laws of Alfonso the Tenth, prepared about
1260, good knights are commanded to listen to no poetical tales
of the ballad-singers except such as relate to feats of arms.<a
id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
In the “General Chronicle,” also, compiled soon afterwards by the
same prince, mention is made more than once of poetical gestes or
tales; of “what the ballad-singers (<i>juglares</i>) sing in their chants,
and tell in their tales”; and “of what we hear the ballad-singers
tell in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
chants”;—implying that the achievements of Bernardo del Carpio and
Charlemagne, to which these phrases refer, were as familiar in the
popular poetry used in the composition of this fine old chronicle as
we know they have been since to the whole Spanish people through the
very ballads we still possess.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183"
class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>It seems, therefore, not easy to escape from the conclusion, to
which Argote de Molina, the most sagacious of the early Spanish
critics, arrived nearly three centuries ago, that “in these old
ballads is, in truth, perpetuated the memory of times past, and
that they constitute a good part of those ancient Castilian
stories used by King Alfonso in his history”;<a id="FNanchor_184"
href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> a conclusion at which
we should arrive, even now, merely by reading with care large portions
of the Chronicle itself.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185"
class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>One more fact will conclude what we know of their early history.
It is, that ballads were found among the poetry of Don John Manuel,
the nephew of Alfonso the Tenth, which Argote de Molina possessed,
and intended to publish, but which is now lost.<a id="FNanchor_186"
href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> This brings our slight
knowledge of the whole subject down to the death of Don John in 1347.
But from this period—the same with that of the Archpriest of Hita—we
almost lose sight, not only of the ballads, but of all genuine Spanish
poetry, whose strains seem hardly to have been heard during the horrors
of the reign of Peter the Cruel, the contested succession of Henry of
Trastamara,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span> and
the Portuguese wars of John the First. And even when its echoes come
to us again in the weak reign of John the Second, which stretches down
to the middle of the fifteenth century, it presents itself with few
of the attributes of the old national character.<a id="FNanchor_187"
href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> It is become of the
court, courtly; and therefore, though the old and true-hearted ballads
may have lost none of the popular favor, and were certainly preserved
by the fidelity of popular tradition, we find no further distinct
record of them until the end of this century and the beginning of the
one that followed, when the mass of the people, whose feelings they
embodied, rose to such a degree of consideration, that their peculiar
poetry came into the place to which it was entitled, and which it
has maintained ever since. This was in the reigns of Ferdinand and
Isabella, and of Charles the Fifth.</p>

<p>But these few historical notices of ballad poetry are, except
those which point to its early origin, too slight to be of much
value. Indeed, until after the middle of the sixteenth century, it is
difficult to find ballads written by known authors; so that, when we
speak of the Old Spanish Ballads, we do not refer to the few whose
period can be settled with some accuracy, but to the great mass found
in the “Romanceros Generales” and elsewhere, whose authors and dates
are alike unknown. This mass consists of above a thousand old poems,
unequal in length and still more unequal in merit, composed between the
period when verse first appeared in Spain and the time when such verse
as that of the ballads was thought worthy to be written down; the whole
bearing to the mass of the Spanish people, their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span> feelings, passions, and character, the
same relations that a single ballad bears to the character of the
individual author who produced it.</p>

<p>For a long time, of course, these primitive national ballads existed
only in the memories of the common people, from whom they sprang, and
were preserved through successive ages and long traditions only by the
interests and feelings that originally gave them birth. We cannot,
therefore, reasonably hope that we now read any of them exactly as they
were first composed and sung, or that there are many to which we can
assign a definite age with any good degree of probability. No doubt,
we may still possess some which, with little change in their simple
thoughts and melody, were among the earliest breathings of that popular
enthusiasm which, between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries,
was carrying the Christian Spaniards onward to the emancipation of
their country; ballads which were heard amidst the valleys of the
Sierra Morena, or on the banks of the Turia and the Guadalquivir, with
the first tones of the language that has since spread itself through
the whole Peninsula. But the idle minstrel, who, in such troubled
times, sought a precarious subsistence from cottage to cottage, or
the thoughtless soldier, who, when the battle was over, sung its
achievements to his guitar at the door of his tent, could not be
expected to look beyond the passing moment; so that, if their unskilled
verses were preserved at all, they must have been preserved by those
who repeated them from memory, changing their tone and language with
the changed feelings of the times and events that chanced to recall
them. Whatever, then, belongs to this earliest period belongs, at the
same time, to the unchronicled popular life and character of which it
was a part; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>
although many of the ballads thus produced may have survived to our own
day, many more, undoubtedly, lie buried with the poetical hearts that
gave them birth.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is the great difficulty in relation to all researches
concerning the oldest Spanish ballads. The very excitement of the
national spirit that warmed them into life was the result of an age
of such violence and suffering, that the ballads it produced failed
to command such an interest as would cause them to be written down.
Individual poems, like that of the Cid, or the works of individual
authors, like those of the Archpriest of Hita or Don John Manuel, were,
of course, cared for, and, perhaps, from time to time transcribed.
But the popular poetry was neglected. Even when the special
“Cancioneros”—which were collections of whatever verses the person who
formed them happened to fancy, or was able to find<a id="FNanchor_188"
href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>—began to come in
fashion, during the reign of John the Second, the bad taste of the time
caused the old national literature to be so entirely overlooked, that
not a single ballad occurs in either of them.</p>

<p>The first printed ballads, therefore, are to be sought in the
earliest edition of the “Cancioneros Generales,” compiled by Fernando
del Castillo, and printed at Valencia in 1511. Their number, including
fragments and imitations, is thirty-seven, of which nineteen are
by authors whose names are given, and who, like Don John Manuel of
Portugal, Alonso de Cartagena, Juan de la Enzina, and Diego de San
Pedro, are known to have flourished in the period between 1450 and
1500, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span> who, like
Lope de Sosa, appear so often in the collections of that age, that
they may be fairly assumed to have belonged to it. Of the remainder,
several seem much more ancient, and are, therefore, more curious and
important.</p>

<p>The first, for instance, called “Count Claros,” is the fragment
of an old ballad afterwards printed in full. It is inserted in this
Cancionero on account of an elaborate gloss made on it in the Provençal
manner by Francisco de Leon, as well as on account of an imitation of
it by Lope de Sosa, and a gloss upon the imitation by Soria; all of
which follow, and leave little doubt that the ballad itself had long
been known and admired. The fragment, which alone is curious, consists
of a dialogue between the Count Claros and his uncle, the Archbishop,
on a subject and in a tone which made the name of the Count, as a true
lover, pass almost into a proverb.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">“It grieves me, Count, it grieves my heart,</p>
<p class="i2">That thus they urge thy fate;</p>
<p class="i0">Since this fond guilt upon thy part</p>
<p class="i2">Was still no crime of state.</p>
<p class="i0">For all the errors love can bring</p>

<p class="i2">To free thee from thy chain.</p>
<p class="i0">But he, the king, with angry pride</p>
<p class="i2">Would hear no word I spoke;</p>
<p class="i0">‘The sentence is pronounced,’ he cried;</p>
<p class="i2">‘Who may its power revoke?’</p>
<p class="i0">The Infanta’s love you won, he says,</p>
<p class="i2">When you her guardian were.</p>
<p class="i0">O cousin, less, if you were wise,</p>
<p class="i2">For ladies you would care.</p>
<p class="i0">For he that labors most for them</p>
<p class="i2">Your fate will always prove;</p>
<p class="i0">Since death or ruin none escape,</p>

<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span>“O uncle, uncle, words like these</p>

<p class="i2">Than live and not be theirs.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>The next is also a fragment, and relates, with great simplicity, an
incident which belongs to the state of society that existed in Spain
between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the two races were
much mingled together and always in conflict.</p>

<p class="i2">I threw it wide at his behest.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>The next is
complete, and, from its early imitations and glosses, it must probably
be quite ancient. It begins “Fonte frida, Fonte frida,” and is,
perhaps, itself an imitation of “Rosa fresca, Rosa fresca,” another
of the early and very graceful lyrical ballads which were always so
popular.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Cooling fountain, cooling fountain,</p>

<p class="i0">There the traitor nightingale</p>
<p class="i2">All by chance once passed along,</p>
<p class="i0">Uttering words of basest falsehood</p>
<p class="i2">In his guilty, treacherous song:</p>
<p class="i0">“If it please thee, gentle lady,</p>
<p class="i2">I thy servant-love would be.”</p>
<p class="i0">“Hence, begone, ungracious traitor,</p>
<p class="i2">Base deceiver, hence from me!</p>
<p class="i0">I nor rest upon green branches,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor amidst the meadow’s flowers;</p>
<p class="i0">The very wave my thirst that quenches</p>

<p>The parallel ballad of “Rosa fresca, Rosa fresca,” is<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span> no less simple and
characteristic; Rosa being the name of the lady-love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span>Several of
the other anonymous ballads in this little collection are not less
curious and ancient, among which may be noted those beginning, “Decidme
vos pensamiento,”—“Que por Mayo era por Mayo,”—and “Durandarte,
Durandarte,”—together with parts of those beginning, “Triste estaba
el caballero,” and “Amara yo una Señora.”<a id="FNanchor_192"
href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Most of the rest, and
all whose authors are known, are of less value and belong to a later
period.</p>

<p>The Cancionero of Castillo, where they appeared, was enlarged and
altered in eight subsequent editions, the last of which was published
in 1573; but in all of them this little collection of ballads,
as originally printed in the first edition, remained by itself,
unchanged, though in the additions of newer poetry a modern ballad
is occasionally inserted.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193"
class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It may, therefore, be doubted whether the
General Cancioneros did much to attract attention to the ballad poetry
of the country, especially when we bear in mind that they are almost
entirely filled with the works of the conceited school of the period
that produced them, and were probably little known except among the
courtly classes, who placed small value on what was old and national
in their poetical literature.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194"
class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>But while the Cancioneros were still in course of publication, a
separate effort was made in the right direction to preserve the old
ballads, and proved successful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p.
126]</span> In 1550, Stevan G. de Nagera printed, at Saragossa, in two
successive parts, what he called a “Silva de Romances,” the errors of
which he partly excuses in his Preface, on the ground that the memories
of those from whom he gathered the ballads he publishes were often
imperfect. Here, then, is the oldest of the proper ballad-books; one
obviously taken from the traditions of the country. It is, therefore,
the most curious and important of them all. A considerable number
of the short poems it contains must, however, be regarded only as
fragments of popular ballads already lost; while, on the contrary,
that on the Count Claros is the complete one, of which the Cancionero,
published forty years earlier, had given only such small portions as
its editor had been able to pick up; both striking facts, which show,
in opposite ways, that the ballads here collected were obtained, as the
Preface says they were, from the memories of the people.</p>

<p>As might be anticipated from such an origin, their character
and tone are very various. Some are connected with the fictions
of chivalry, and the story of Charlemagne; the most remarkable
of which are those on Gayferos and Melisendra, on the Marquis of
Mantua and on Count Irlos.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195"
class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Others, like that of the cross miraculously
made for Alfonso the Chaste, and that on the all of Valencia, belong to
the early history of Spain,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and may well have been among those<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span> old Castilian ballads
which Argote de Molina says were used in compiling the “General
Chronicle.” And finally, we have that deep, domestic tragedy of Count
Alarcos, which goes back to some period in the national history or
traditions of which we have no other early record.<a id="FNanchor_197"
href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Few among them, even
the shortest and least perfect, are without interest; as, for instance,
the obviously old one in which Virgil figures as a person punished
for seducing the affections of a king’s daughter.<a id="FNanchor_198"
href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> As specimens, however,
of the national tone which prevails in most of the collection, it
is better to read such ballads as that upon the rout of Roderic on
the eighth day of the battle that surrendered Spain to the Moors,<a
id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> or
that on Garci Perez de Vargas, taken, probably, from the “General
Chronicle,” and founded on a fact of so much consequence as to be
recorded by Mariana, and so popular as to be referred to for its
notoriety by Cervantes.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200"
class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The genuine ballad-book thus published was so suc<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>cessful, that, in less
than five years, three editions or recensions of it appeared; that
of 1555, commonly called the Cancionero of Antwerp, being the last,
the amplest, and the best known. Other similar collections followed;
particularly, one in nine parts, which, between 1593 and 1597, were
separately published at Valencia, Burgos, Toledo, Alcalá, and Madrid; a
variety of sources, to which we no doubt owe, not only the preservation
of so great a number of old ballads, but much of the richness
and diversity we find in their subjects and tone;—all the great
divisions of the kingdom, except the southwest, having sent in their
long-accumulated wealth to fill this first great treasure-house of the
national popular poetry. Like its humbler predecessor, it had great
success. Large as it was originally, it was still further increased
in four subsequent recensions, that appeared in the course of about
fifteen years; the last being that of 1605-1614, in thirteen parts,
constituting the great repository called the “Romancero General,” from
which, and from the smaller and earlier ballad-books, we still draw
nearly all that is curious and interesting in the old popular poetry of
Spain. The whole number of ballads found in these several volumes is
considerably over a thousand.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201"
class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>But since the appearance of these collections, above two centuries
ago, little has been done to increase our stock of old Spanish ballads.
Small ballad-books on particular subjects, like those of the Twelve
Peers and of the Cid, were, indeed, early selected from the larger
ones, and have since been frequently called for by the general favor;
but still it should be understood, that, from the middle and latter
part of the seventeenth cen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p.
129]</span>tury, the true popular ballads, drawn from the hearts and
traditions of the common people, were thought little worthy of regard,
and remained until lately floating about among the humbler classes that
gave them birth. There, however, as if in their native homes, they
have always been no less cherished and cultivated than they were at
their first appearance, and there the old ballad-books themselves were
oftenest found, until they were brought forth anew, to enjoy the favor
of all, by Quintana, Depping, and Duran, who, in this, have but obeyed
the feeling of the age in which we live.</p>

<p>The old collections of the sixteenth century, however, are still
the only safe and sufficient sources in which to seek the true old
ballads. That of 1593-1597 is particularly valuable, as we have already
intimated, from the circumstance, that its materials were gathered
so widely out of different parts of Spain; and if to the multitude
of ballads it contains we add those found in the Cancionero of 1511,
and in the ballad-book of 1550, we shall have the great body of the
anonymous ancient Spanish ballads, more near to that popular tradition
which was the common source of what is best in them than we can find it
anywhere else.</p>

<p>But, from whatever source we may now draw them, we must give up,
at once, all hope of arranging them in chronological order. They
were originally printed in small volumes, or on separate sheets,
as they chanced, from time to time, to be composed or found,—those
that were taken from the memories of the blind ballad-singers in the
streets by the side of those that were taken from the works of Lope
de Vega and Góngora; and just as they were first collected, so they
were afterwards heaped together in the General Romanceros, without
affixing to them the names of their authors, or<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span> attempting to distinguish the ancient
ballads from the recent, or even to group together such as belonged
to the same subject. Indeed, they seem to have been published at all
merely to furnish amusement to the less cultivated classes at home,
or to solace the armies that were fighting the battles of Charles the
Fifth and Philip the Second, in Italy, Germany, and Flanders; so that
an orderly arrangement of any kind was a matter of small consequence.
Nothing remains for us, therefore, but to consider them by their
<i>subjects</i>; and for this purpose the most convenient distribution will
be, first, into such as relate to fictions of chivalry, and especially
to Charlemagne and his peers; next, such as regard Spanish history
and traditions, with a few relating to classical antiquity; then such
as are founded on Moorish adventures; and lastly, such as belong to
the private life and manners of the Spaniards themselves. What do not
fall naturally under one of these divisions are not, probably, ancient
ballads; or, if they are such, are not of consequence enough to be
separately noticed.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Ballads of Chivalry.</i>—The first thing that strikes us, on opening
any one of the old Spanish ballad-books, is the national air and
spirit that prevail throughout them. But we look in vain for many of
the fictions found in the popular poetry of other countries at the
same period, some of which we might well expect to find here. Even
that chivalry, which was so akin to the character and condition of
Spain when the ballads appeared, fails to sweep by us with the train
of its accustomed personages. Of Arthur and his Round Table the old
ballads tell us nothing at all, nor of the “Mervaile of the Graal,”
nor of Perceval, nor of the Palmerins, nor of many other well-known
and famous heroes of the shadow land of chivalry. Later, indeed, some
of these personages figure largely in the Spanish prose romances. But,
for a long time, the history of Spain itself furnished materials enough
for its more popular poetry; and therefore, though Amadis, Lancelot
du Lac, Tristan de Leonnais, and their compeers, present themselves
now and then in the ballads, it is not till after the prose romances,
filled with their adventures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p.
132]</span> had made them familiar. Even then, they are somewhat
awkwardly introduced, and never occupy any well-defined place; for
the stories of the Cid and Bernardo del Carpio were much nearer to
the hearts of the Spanish people, and had left little space for such
comparatively cold and unsubstantial fancies.</p>

<p>The only considerable exception to this remark is to be found
in the stories connected with Charlemagne and his peers. That
great sovereign—who, in the darkest period of Europe since the
days of the Roman republic, roused up the nations, not only by
the glory of his military conquests, but by the magnificence of
his civil institutions—crossed the Pyrenees in the latter part
of the eighth century, at the solicitation of one of his Moorish
allies, and ravaged the Spanish marches as far as the Ebro, taking
Pamplona and Saragossa.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202"
class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The impression he made there seems to have
been the same he made everywhere; and from this time the splendor of
his great name and deeds was connected in the minds of the Spanish
people with wild imaginations of their own achievements, and gave birth
to that series of fictions which is embraced in the story of Bernardo
del Carpio, and ends with the great rout, when, according to the
persuasions of the national vanity,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">“Charlemain with all his peerage fell</p>
<p class="i0">By Fontarabbia.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>These picturesque adventures, chiefly without countenance from
history, in which the French paladins appear associated with fabulous
Spanish heroes, such as Montesinos and Durandarte,<a id="FNanchor_203"
href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and once with the
noble Moor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>
Calaynos, are represented with some minuteness in the old Spanish
ballads. The largest number, including the longest and the best, are
to be found in the ballad-book of 1550-1555, to which may be added
a few from that of 1593-1597, making together somewhat more than
fifty, of which only twenty occur in the collection expressly devoted
to the Twelve Peers, and first published in 1608. Some of them are
evidently very old; as, for instance, that on the Conde d’ Irlos,
that on the Marquis of Mantua, two on Claros of Montalban, and both
the fragments on Durandarte, the last of which can be traced back
to the Cancionero of 1511.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204"
class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The ballads of this class are occasionally quite long, and approach
the character of the old French and English metrical romances; that
of the Conde d’ Irlos extending to about thirteen hundred lines. The
longer ballads, too, are generally the best; and those, through large
portions of which the same <i>asonante</i>, and sometimes, even, the same
<i>consonante</i> or full rhyme, is continued to the end, have a solemn
harmony in their protracted cadences, that produces an effect on the
feelings like the chanting of a rich and well-sustained recitative.</p>

<p>Taken as a body, they have a grave tone, combined with the spirit of
a picturesque narrative, and entirely different from the extravagant
and romantic air afterwards given to the same class of fictions in
Italy, and even from that of the few Spanish ballads which, at a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> later period, were
constructed out of the imaginative and fantastic materials found in
the poems of Bojardo and Ariosto. But in all ages and in all forms,
they have been favorites with the Spanish people. They were alluded to
as such above five hundred years ago, in the oldest of the national
chronicles; and when, at the end of the last century, Sarmiento
notices the ballad-book of the Twelve Peers, he speaks of it as one
which the peasantry and the children of Spain still knew by heart.<a
id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>Historical Ballads.</i>—The most important and the
largest division of the Spanish ballads is, however, the historical.
Nor is this surprising. The early heroes in Spanish history grew so
directly out of the popular character, and the early achievements of
the national arms so nearly touched the personal condition of every
Christian in the Peninsula, that they naturally became the first and
chief subjects of a poetry which has always, to a remarkable degree,
been the breathing of the popular feelings and passions. It would be
easy, therefore, to collect a series of ballads,—few in number as far
as respects the Gothic and Roman periods, but ample from the time of
Roderic and the Moorish conquest of Spain down to the moment when its
restoration was gloriously fulfilled in the fall of Granada,—a series
which would constitute such a poetical illustration of Spanish history
as can be brought in aid of the history of no other country. But,
for our present purpose, it is enough to select a few sketches from
these remarkable ballads devoted to the greater heroes,—personages
half-shadowy, half-historical,—who, between the end of the eighth and
the beginning of the twelfth century, occupy a wide space in all the
old traditions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>
serve alike to illustrate the early popular character in Spain, and the
poetry to which that character gave birth.</p>

<p>The first of these, in the order of time, is Bernardo del Carpio,
concerning whom we have about forty ballads, which, with the accounts
in the Chronicle of Alfonso the Wise, have constituted the foundations
for many a drama and tale, and at least three long heroic poems.
According to these early narratives, Bernardo flourished about the
year 800, and was the offspring of a secret marriage between the
Count de Saldaña and the sister of Alfonso the Chaste, at which
the king was so much offended, that he kept the Count in perpetual
imprisonment, and sent the Infanta to a convent; educating Bernardo as
his own son, and keeping him ignorant of his birth. The achievements
of Bernardo, ending with the victory of Roncesvalles,—his efforts
to procure the release of his father, when he learns who his father
is,—the falsehood of the king, who promises repeatedly to give up
the Count de Saldaña and as often breaks his word,—with the despair
of Bernardo, and his final rebellion, after the Count’s death in
prison,—are all as fully represented in the ballads as they are
in the chronicles, and constitute some of the most romantic and
interesting portions of each.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206"
class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Of the ballads which contain this story, and which generally
suppose the whole of it to have passed in one reign, though the
Chronicle spreads it over three, none, perhaps, is finer than the one
in which the Count de Saldaña, in his solitary prison, complains of
his son, who, he supposes, must know his descent, and of his wife, the
Infanta, who, he presumes, must be in league<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span> with her royal brother. After a
description of the castle in which he is confined, the Count says:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The tale of my imprisoned life</p>
<p class="i2">Within these loathsome walls,</p>
<p class="i0">Each moment, as it lingers by,</p>
<p class="i2">My hoary hair recalls;</p>
<p class="i0">For when this castle first I saw,</p>
<p class="i2">My beard was scarcely grown,</p>
<p class="i0">And now, to purge my youthful sins,</p>
<p class="i2">Its folds hang whitening down.</p>
<p class="i0">Then where art thou, my careless son?</p>
<p class="i2">And why so dull and cold?</p>
<p class="i0">Doth not my blood within thee run?</p>
<p class="i2">Speaks it not loud and bold?</p>
<p class="i0">Alas! it may be so, but still</p>
<p class="i2">Thy mother’s blood is thine;</p>
<p class="i0">And what is kindred to the king</p>
<p class="i2">Will plead no cause of mine:</p>
<p class="i0">And thus all three against me stand;—</p>
<p class="i2">For the whole man to quell,</p>
<p class="i0">’T is not enough to have our foes,</p>
<p class="i2">Our heart’s blood must rebel.</p>
<p class="i0">Meanwhile, the guards that watch me here</p>
<p class="i2">Of thy proud conquests boast;</p>
<p class="i0">But if for me thou lead’st it not,</p>
<p class="i2">For whom, then, fights thy host?</p>
<p class="i0">And since thou leav’st me prisoned here,</p>
<p class="i2">In cruel chains to groan,</p>
<p class="i0">Or I must be a guilty sire,</p>
<p class="i2">Or thou a guilty son!</p>
<p class="i0">Yet pardon me, if I offend</p>
<p class="i2">By uttering words so free;</p>
<p class="i0">For while oppressed with age I moan,</p>
<p class="i2">No words come back from thee.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>The old Spanish
ballads have often a resemblance to each other in their tone and
phraseology; and occasionally several seem imitated from some common
original. Thus, in another, on this same subject of the Count de
Saldaña’s imprisonment, we find the length of time he had suffered,
and the idea of his relationship and blood, enforced in the following
words, not of the Count himself, but of Bernardo, when addressing the
king:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The very walls are wearied there,</p>
<p class="i2">So long in grief to hold</p>
<p class="i0">A man whom first in youth they saw,</p>
<p class="i2">And now see gray and old.</p>
<p class="i0">And if, for errors such as these,</p>
<p class="i2">The forfeit must be blood,</p>
<p class="i0">Enough of his has flowed from me,</p>
<p class="i2">When for your rights I stood.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>In reading the ballads relating to Bernardo del Carpio, it is
impossible not to be often struck with their resemblance to the
corresponding passages of the “General Chronicle.” Some of them
are undoubtedly copied from it; others possibly may have been,
in more ancient forms, among the poetical materials out of which
we know that Chronicle was in part composed.<a id="FNanchor_209"
href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The best<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span> are those which are least
strictly conformed to the history itself; but all, taken together, form
a curious and interesting series, that serves strikingly to exhibit
the manners and feelings of the people in the wild times of which they
speak, as well as in the later periods when many of them must have been
written.</p>

<p>The next series is that on Fernan Gonzalez, a popular chieftain,
whom we have already mentioned, when noticing his metrical chronicle;
and one who, in the middle of the tenth century, recovered Castile
anew from the Moors, and became its first sovereign Count. The number
of ballads relating to him is not large; probably not twenty. The most
poetical are those which describe his being twice rescued from prison
by his courageous wife, and those which relate his contest with King
Sancho, where he displayed all the turbulence and cunning of a robber
baron, in the Middle Ages. Nearly all their facts may be found in the
Third Part of the “General Chronicle”; and though only a few of the
ballads themselves appear to be derived from it as distinctly as some
of those on Bernardo del Carpio, still two or three are evidently
indebted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> that
Chronicle for their materials and phraseology, while yet others may
possibly, in some ruder shape, have preceded it, and contributed
to its composition.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210"
class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The ballads which naturally form the next group are those on the
Seven Lords of Lara, who lived in the time of Garcia Ferrandez, the
son of Fernan Gonzalez. Some of them are beautiful, and the story they
contain is one of the most romantic in Spanish history. The seven
Lords of Lara, in consequence of a family quarrel, are betrayed by
their uncle into the hands of the Moors, and put to death; while their
father, by the basest treason, is confined in a Moorish prison, where,
by a noble Moorish lady, he has an eighth son, the famous Mudarra, who
at last avenges all the wrongs of his race. On this story there are
about thirty ballads; some very old, and exhibiting either inventions
or traditions not elsewhere recorded, while others seem to have come
directly from the “General Chronicle.” The following is a part of one
of the last, and a good specimen of the whole:—<a id="FNanchor_211"
href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">What knight goes there, so false and fair,</p>
<p class="i2">That thus for treason stood?</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>Velasquez hight is that false knight,</p>
<p class="i2">Who sold his brother’s blood.</p>
<p class="i0">Where Almenar extends afar,</p>
<p class="i2">He called his nephews forth,</p>
<p class="i0">And on that plain he bade them gain</p>
<p class="i2">A name of fame and worth.</p>
<p class="i0">The Moors he shows, the common foes,</p>
<p class="i2">And promises their rout;</p>
<p class="i0">But while they stood, prepared for blood,</p>
<p class="i2">A mighty host came out.</p>
<p class="i0">Of Moorish men were thousands ten,</p>
<p class="i2">With pennons flowing fair;</p>
<p class="i0">Whereat each knight, as well he might,</p>
<p class="i2">Inquired what host came there.</p>
<p class="i0">“O, do not fear, my kinsmen dear,”</p>
<p class="i2">The base Velasquez cried,</p>
<p class="i0">“The Moors you see can never be</p>
<p class="i2">Of power your shock to bide;</p>
<p class="i0">I oft have met their craven set,</p>
<p class="i2">And none dared face my might;</p>
<p class="i0">So think no fear, my kinsmen dear,</p>
<p class="i2">But boldly seek the fight.”</p>
<p class="i0">Thus words deceive, and men believe,</p>
<p class="i2">And falsehood thrives amain;</p>
<p class="i0">And those brave knights, for Christian rights,</p>
<p class="i2">Have sped across the plain;</p>
<p class="i0">And men ten score, but not one more,</p>
<p class="i2">To follow freely chose:</p>
<p class="i0">So Velasquez base his kin and race</p>
<p class="i2">Has bartered to their foes.</p>

<p>But, as might be anticipated, the Cid was seized upon with the first
formation of the language as the subject of popular poetry, and has
been the occasion of more ballads than any other of the great heroes
of Spanish history or fable.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212"
class="fnanchor">[212]</a> They were first collected in a separate
ballad-book as early as 1612, and have continued<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> to be published and republished
at home and abroad down to our own times.<a id="FNanchor_213"
href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> It would be easy to
find a hundred and sixty; some of them very ancient; some poetical;
many prosaic and poor. The chronicles seem to have been little resorted
to in their composition.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214"
class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The circumstances of the Cid’s history,
whether true or fictitious, were too well settled in the popular faith,
and too familiar to all Christian Spaniards, to render the use of such
materials necessary. No portion of the old ballads, therefore, is more
strongly marked with the spirit of their age and country; and none
constitutes a series so complete. They give us apparently the whole of
the Cid’s history, which we find nowhere else entire; neither in the
ancient poem, which does not pretend to be a life of him; nor in the
prose chronicle, which does not begin so early in his story; nor in the
Latin document, which is too brief and condensed. At the very outset,
we have the following minute and living picture of the mortification
and sufferings of Diego Laynez, the Cid’s father, in consequence of
the blow he had received from Count Lozano, which his age rendered it
impossible for him to avenge:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Sorrowing old Laynez sat,</p>
<p class="i2">Sorrowing on the deep disgrace</p>
<p class="i0">Of his house, so rich and knightly,</p>
<p class="i2">Older than Abarca’s race.</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>For he saw that youthful strength</p>
<p class="i2">To avenge his wrong was needed;</p>
<p class="i0">That, by years enfeebled, broken,</p>
<p class="i2">None his arm now feared or heeded.</p>
<p class="i0">But he of Orgaz, Count Lozano,</p>
<p class="i2">Walks secure where men resort;</p>
<p class="i0">Hindered and rebuked by none,</p>
<p class="i2">Proud his name, and proud his port.</p>
<p class="i0">While he, the injured, neither sleeps,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor tastes the needful food,</p>
<p class="i0">Nor from the ground dares lift his eyes,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor moves a step abroad,</p>
<p class="i0">Nor friends in friendly converse meets,</p>
<p class="i2">But hides in shame his face;</p>
<p class="i0">His very breath, he thinks, offends,</p>
<p class="i2">Charged with insult and disgrace.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>In this state of his father’s feelings, Roderic, a mere stripling,
determines to avenge the insult by challenging Count Lozano, then the
most dangerous knight and the first nobleman in the kingdom. The result
is the death of his proud and injurious enemy; but the daughter of the
fallen Count, the fair Ximena, demands vengeance of the king, and the
whole is adjusted, after the rude fashion of those times, by a marriage
between the parties, which necessarily ends the feud.</p>

<p>The ballads, thus far, relate only to the early youth of the Cid in
the reign of Ferdinand the Great, and constitute a separate series,
that gave to Guillen de Castro, and after him to Corneille, the best
materials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span> for their
respective tragedies on this part of the Cid’s story. But at the death
of Ferdinand, his kingdom was divided, according to his will, among
his four children; and then we have another series of ballads on the
part taken by the Cid in the wars almost necessarily produced by such
a division, and in the siege of Zamora, which fell to the share of
Queen Urraca, and was assailed by her brother, Sancho the Brave. In one
of these ballads, the Cid, sent by Sancho to summon the city, is thus
reproached and taunted by Urraca, who is represented as standing on one
of its towers, and answering him as he addressed her from below:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Away! away! proud Roderic!</p>
<p class="i2">Castilian proud, away!</p>
<p class="i0">Bethink thee of that olden time,</p>
<p class="i2">That happy, honored day,</p>
<p class="i0">When, at Saint James’s holy shrine,</p>
<p class="i2">Thy knighthood first was won;</p>
<p class="i0">When Ferdinand, my royal sire,</p>
<p class="i2">Confessed thee for a son.</p>
<p class="i0">He gave thee then thy knightly arms,</p>
<p class="i2">My mother gave thy steed;</p>
<p class="i0">Thy spurs were buckled by these hands,</p>
<p class="i2">That thou no grace might’st need.</p>
<p class="i0">And had not chance forbid the vow,</p>
<p class="i2">I thought with thee to wed;</p>
<p class="i0">But Count Lozano’s daughter fair</p>
<p class="i2">Thy happy bride was led.</p>
<p class="i0">With her came wealth, an ample store,</p>
<p class="i2">But power was mine, and state:</p>
<p class="i0">Broad lands are good, and have their grace,</p>
<p class="i2">But he that reigns is great.</p>
<p class="i0">Thy wife is well; thy match was wise;</p>
<p class="i2">Yet, Roderic! at thy side</p>
<p class="i0">A vassal’s daughter sits by thee,</p>
<p class="i2">And not a royal bride!<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>Alfonso the
Sixth succeeded on the death of Sancho, who perished miserably by
treason before the walls of Zamora; but the Cid quarrelled with
his new master, and was exiled. At this moment begins the old poem
already mentioned; but even here and afterwards the ballads form a
more continuous account of his life, carrying us, often with great
minuteness of detail, through his conquest of Valencia, his restoration
to the king’s favor, his triumph over the Counts of Carrion, his old
age, death, and burial, and giving us, when taken together, what
Müller the historian and Herder the philosopher consider, in its main
circumstances, a trustworthy history, but what can hardly be more than
a poetical version of traditions current at the different times when
its different portions were composed.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the earlier part of the period when historical ballads
were written, their subjects seem rather to have been chosen among
the traditional heroes of the country, than among the known and
ascertained events in its annals. Much fiction, of course, was mingled
with whatever related to such personages by the willing credulity of
patriotism, and portions of the ballads about them are incredible to
any modern faith; so that we can hardly fail to agree with the good
sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span> of the canon
in Don Quixote, when he says, “There is no doubt there was such a
man as the Cid and such a man as Bernardo del Carpio, but much doubt
whether they achieved what is imputed to them”;<a id="FNanchor_217"
href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> while, at the same
time, we must admit there is no less truth in the shrewd intimation of
Sancho, that, after all, the old ballads are too old to tell lies. At
least, some of them are so.</p>

<p>At a later period, all sorts of subjects were introduced into
the ballads; ancient subjects as well as modern, sacred as well
as profane. Even the Greek and Roman fables were laid under
contribution, as if they were historically true; but more ballads
are connected with Spanish history than with any other, and, in
general, they are better. The most striking peculiarity of the whole
mass is, perhaps, to be found in the degree in which it expresses
the national character. Loyalty is constantly prominent. The Lord
of Buitrago sacrifices his own life to save that of his sovereign.<a
id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The
Cid sends rich spoils from his conquests in Valencia to the ungrateful
king who had driven him thither as an exile.<a id="FNanchor_219"
href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Bernardo del Carpio
bows in submission to the uncle who basely and brutally outrages<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span> his filial affections;<a
id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and
when, driven to despair, he rebels, the ballads and the chronicles
absolutely forsake him. In short, this and the other strong traits of
the national character are constantly appearing in the old historical
ballads, and constitute a chief part of the peculiar charm that invests
them.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>Ballads on Moorish Subjects.</i>—The Moorish ballads form
a brilliant and large class by themselves, but none of them are as
old as the earliest historical ballads. Indeed, their very subjects
intimate their later origin. Few can be found alluding to known events
or personages that occur before the period immediately preceding the
fall of Granada; and even in these few the proofs of a more recent
and Christian character are abundant. The truth appears to be, that,
after the final overthrow of the Moorish power, when the conquerors
for the first time came into full possession of whatever was most
luxurious in the civilization of their enemies, the tempting subjects
their situation suggested were at once seized upon by the spirit of
their popular poetry. The sweet South, with its picturesque, though
effeminate, refinement; the foreign, yet not absolutely stranger,
manners of its people; its magnificent and fantastic architecture; the
stories of the warlike achievements and disasters at Baza, at Ronda,
and at Alhama, with the romantic adventures and fierce feuds of the
Zegris and Abencerrages, the Gomeles and the Aliatares;—all took strong
hold of the Spanish imagination, and made of Granada, its rich plain
and snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span>capped
mountains, that fairy land which the elder and sterner ballad poetry
of the North had failed to create. From this time, therefore, we find
a new class of subjects, such as the loves of Gazul and Abindarraez,
with games and tournaments in the Bivarrambla, and tales of Arabian
nights in the Generalife; in short, whatever was matter of Moorish
tradition or manners, or might by the popular imagination be deemed
such, was wrought into Spanish ballad poetry, until the very excess
became ridiculous, and the ballads themselves laughed at one another
for deserting their own proper subjects, and becoming, as it were,
renegades to nationality and patriotism.<a id="FNanchor_221"
href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The period when this style of poetry came into favor was the
century that elapsed after the fall of Granada; the same in which all
classes of the ballads were first written down and printed. The early
collections give full proof of this. Those of 1511 and 1550 contain
several Moorish ballads, and that of 1593 contains above two hundred.
But though their subjects involve known occurrences, they are hardly
ever really historical; as, for instance, the well-known ballad on the
tournament in Toledo, which is supposed to have happened before the
year 1085, while its names belong to the period immediately preceding
the fall of Granada; and the ballad of King Belchite, which, like
many others, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span>
a subject purely imaginary. Indeed, this romantic character is the
prevalent one in the ballads of this class, and gives them much of
their interest; a fact well illustrated by that beginning “The star
of Venus rises now,” which is one of the best and most consistent in
the “Romancero General,” and yet, by its allusions to Venus and to
Rodamonte, and its mistake in supposing a Moor to have been Alcayde
of Seville, a century after Seville had become a Christian city,
shows that there was, in its composition, no serious thought of any
thing but poetical effect.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222"
class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>These, with some of the ballads on the famous Gazul, occur in the
popular story of the “Wars of Granada,” where they are treated as if
contemporary with the facts they record, and are beautiful specimens
of the poetry which the Spanish imagination delighted to connect with
that most glorious event in the national history.<a id="FNanchor_223"
href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Others can be found
in a similar tone on the stories, partly or wholly fabulous, of Muça,
Xarifé, Lisaro, and Tarfé; while yet others, in greater number, belong
to the treasons and rivalries, the plots and adventures, of the more
famous Zegris and Abencerrages, which, as far as they are founded in
fact, show how internal dissensions, no less than external disasters,
prepared the way for the final overthrow of the Moorish empire. Some of
them were probably written in the time of Ferdinand and Isabella; many
more in the time of Charles the Fifth; the most brilliant, but not the
best, somewhat later.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>Ballads on Manners and Private Life.</i>—But the bal<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span>lad poetry of Spain was
not confined to heroic subjects drawn from romance or history, or to
subjects depending on Moorish traditions and manners; and therefore,
though these are the three largest classes into which it is divided,
there is yet a fourth, which may be called miscellaneous, and which is
of no little moment. For, in truth, the poetical feelings even of the
lower portions of the Spanish people were spread out over more subjects
than we should anticipate; and their genius, which, from the first,
had a charter as free as the wind, has thus left us a vast number of
records, that prove at least the variety of the popular perceptions,
and the quickness and tenderness of the popular sensibility. Many
of the miscellaneous ballads thus produced—perhaps most of them—are
effusions of love; but many are pastoral, many are burlesque,
satirical, and <i>picaresque</i>; many are called <i>Letrillas</i>, but have
nothing epistolary about them except the name; many are lyrical in
their tone, if not in their form; and many are descriptive of the
manners and amusements of the people at large. But one characteristic
runs through the whole of them. They are true representations of
Spanish life. Some of those first printed have already been referred
to; but there is a considerable class marked by an attractive
simplicity of thought and expression, united to a sort of mischievous
shrewdness, that should be particularly noticed. No such popular
poetry exists in any other language. A number of these ballads occur
in the peculiarly valuable Sixth Part of the Romancero, that appeared
in 1594, and was gathered by Pedro Flores, as he himself tells us, in
part least, from the memories of the common people.<a id="FNanchor_224"
href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> They remind us not unfrequently of
the lighter poetry of the Archpriest of Hita in the middle of the
fourteenth century, and may, probably, be traced back in their tone
and spirit to a yet earlier period. Indeed, they are quite a prominent
and charming part of all the earliest Romanceros, not a few of them
being as simple, and yet as shrewd and humorous, as the following, in
which an elder sister is represented lecturing a younger one, on first
noticing in her the symptoms of love:—</p>

</div></div>

<p>A single specimen like this, however, can give no idea of the great
variety in the class of ballads to which it belongs, nor of their
poetical beauty. To feel their true value and power, we must read large
numbers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span> them,
and read them, too, in their native language; for there is a winning
freshness in the originals, as they lie imbedded in the old Romanceros,
that escapes in translations, however free or however strict;—a remark
that should be extended to the historical as well as the miscellaneous
portions of that great mass of popular poetry which is found in the
early ballad-books, and which, though it is all nearly three centuries
old, and some of it older, has been much less carefully considered than
it deserves to be.</p>

<p>Yet there are certainly few portions of the literature of any
country that will better reward a spirit of adventurous inquiry than
these ancient Spanish ballads, in all their forms. In many respects,
they are unlike the earliest narrative poetry of any other part of
the world; in some, they are better. The English and Scotch ballads,
with which they may most naturally be compared, belong to a ruder
state of society, where a personal coarseness and violence prevailed,
which did not, indeed, prevent the poetry it produced from being
full of energy, and sometimes of tenderness, but which necessarily
had less dignity and elevation than belong to the character, if not
the condition, of a people who, like the Spanish, were for centuries
engaged in a contest ennobled by a sense of religion and loyalty; a
contest which could not fail sometimes to raise the minds and thoughts
of those engaged in it far above such an atmosphere as settled round
the bloody feuds of rival barons or the gross maraudings of a border
warfare. The truth of this will at once be felt, if we compare the
striking series of ballads on Robin Hood with those on the Cid and
Bernardo del Carpio; or if we compare the deep tragedy of Edom o’
Gordon with that of the Conde Alarcos; or what would be better than
either,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> if we would
sit down to the “Romancero General,” with its poetical confusion of
Moorish splendors and Christian loyalty, just when we have come fresh
from Percy’s “Reliques,” or Scott’s “Minstrelsy.”<a id="FNanchor_226"
href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>But, besides what the Spanish ballads possess different from the
popular poetry of the rest of Europe, they exhibit, as no others
exhibit it, that nationality which is the truest element of such poetry
everywhere. They seem, indeed, as we read them, to be often little
more than the great traits of the old Spanish character brought out
by the force of poetical enthusiasm; so that, if their nationality
were taken away from them, they would cease to exist. This, in its
turn, has preserved them down to the present day, and will continue
to preserve them hereafter. The great Castilian heroes, such as the
Cid, Bernardo del Carpio, and Pelayo, are even now an essential
portion of the faith and poetry of the common people of Spain; and
are still, in some degree, honored as they were honored in the age of
the Great Captain, or, farther back, in that of Saint Ferdinand. The
stories of Guarinos, too, and of the defeat of Roncesvalles are still
sung by the wayfaring muleteers, as they were when Don Quixote heard
them in his journeying to Toboso; and the showmen still rehearse the
adventures of Gayferos and Melisendra, in the streets of Seville, as
they did at the solitary inn of Montesinos, when he encountered them
there. In short, the ancient Spanish ballads are so truly national in
their spirit, that they became at once identified with the popular
char<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>acter that
had produced them, and with that same character will go onward, we
doubt not, till the Spanish people shall cease to have a separate

<p><span class="smcap">Chronicles.</span>—Ballad poetry constituted, no
doubt, originally, the amusement and solace of the whole mass of the
Spanish people; for, during a long period of their early history, there
was little division of the nation into strongly marked classes, little
distinction in manners, little variety or progress in refinement. The
wars going on with unappeased violence from century to century, though
by their character not without an elevating and poetical influence upon
all, yet oppressed and crushed all by the sufferings that followed in
their train, and kept the tone and condition of the body of the Spanish
nation more nearly at the same level than the national character was
probably ever kept, for so long a period, in any other Christian
country. But as the great Moorish contest was transferred to the South,
Leon, Castile, and indeed the whole North, became comparatively quiet
and settled. Wealth began to be accumulated in the monasteries, and
leisure followed. The castles, instead of being constantly in a state
of anxious preparation against the common enemy, were converted into
abodes of a crude, but free, hospitality; and those distinctions of
society that come from differ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p.
157]</span>ent degrees of power, wealth, and cultivation grew more
and more apparent. From this time, then, the ballads, though not
really neglected, began to subside into the lower portions of society,
where for so long a period they remained; while the more advanced and
educated sought, or created for themselves, forms of literature better
suited, in some respects, to their altered condition, and marking at
once more leisure and knowledge, and a more settled system of social
life.</p>

<p>The oldest of these forms was that of the Spanish prose chronicles,
which, besides being called for by the changed condition of things,
were the proper successors of the monkish Latin chronicles and legends,
long before known in the country, and were of a nature to win favor
with men who themselves were every day engaged in achievements such
as these very stories celebrated, and who consequently looked on the
whole class of works to which they belonged as the pledge and promise
of their own future fame. The chronicles were, therefore, not only the
natural offspring of the times, but were fostered and favored by the
men who controlled the times.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228"
class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">I. <i>General Chronicles and Royal Chronicles.</i>—Under
such circumstances, we might well anticipate that the proper style
of the Spanish chronicle would first appear at the court, or in
the neighbourhood of the throne; because at court were to be found
the spirit and the materials most likely to give it birth. But it
is still to be considered remarkable, that the first of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span> chronicles in the
order of time, and the first in merit, comes directly from a royal
hand. It is called in the printed copies “The Chronicle of Spain,”
or “The General Chronicle of Spain,” and is, no doubt, the same
work earlier cited in manuscript as “The History of Spain.”<a
id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> In
its characteristic Prologue, after solemnly giving the reasons why
such a work ought to be compiled, we are told: “And therefore we,
Don Alfonso, ... son of the very noble King Don Fernando, and of the
Queen Doña Beatrice, have ordered to be collected as many books as
we could have of histories that relate any thing of the deeds done
aforetime in Spain, and have taken the chronicle of the Archbishop
Don Rodrigo, ... and of Master Lucas, Bishop of Tuy, ... and composed
this book”; words which give us the declaration of Alfonso the
Wise, that he himself composed this Chronicle,<a id="FNanchor_230"
href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and which thus carry
it back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> certainly
to a period before the year 1284, in which he died. From internal
evidence, however, it is probable that it was written in the early
part of his reign, which began in 1252; and that he was assisted in
its composition by persons familiar with Arabic literature and with
whatever there was of other refinement in the age.<a id="FNanchor_231"
href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>It is divided, perhaps not by its author, into four parts: the first
opening with the creation of the world, and giving a large space to
Roman history, but hastening over every thing else till it comes to
the occupation of Spain by the Visigoths; the second comprehending the
Gothic empire of the country and its conquest by the Moors; the third
coming down to the reign of Ferdinand the Great, early in the eleventh
century; and the fourth closing in 1252, with the death of Saint
Ferdinand, the conqueror of Andalusia and father of Alfonso himself.</p>

<p>Its earliest portions are the least interesting. They contain
such notions and accounts of antiquity, and especially of the Roman
empire, as were current among the common writers of the Middle
Ages, though occasionally, as in the case of Dido,—whose memory
has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span> always been
defended by the more popular chroniclers and poets of Spain against
the imputations of Virgil,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232"
class="fnanchor">[232]</a>—we have a glimpse of feelings and opinions
which may be considered more national. Such passages naturally become
more frequent in the Second Part, which relates to the empire of the
Visigoths in Spain; though here, as the ecclesiastical writers are
almost the only authority that could be resorted to, their peculiar
tone prevails too much. But the Third Part is quite free and genial in
its spirit, and truly Spanish; setting forth the rich old traditions of
the country about the first outbreak of Pelayo from the mountains;<a
id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
the stories of Bernardo del Carpio,<a id="FNanchor_234"
href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Fernan Gonzalez,<a
id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and
the Seven Children of Lara;<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236"
class="fnanchor">[236]</a> with spirited sketches of Charlemagne,<a
id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
and accounts of miracles like those of the cross made by angels
for Alfonso the Chaste,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238"
class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and of Santiago fighting against
the infidels in the glorious battles of Clavijo and Hazinas.<a
id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The last part, though less carefully compiled and elaborated,
is in the same general tone. It opens with the well-known
history of the Cid,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240"
class="fnanchor">[240]</a> to whom, as to the great hero of the popular
admiration, a disproportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p.
161]</span>ate space is assigned. After this, being already within
a hundred and fifty years of the writer’s own time, we, of course,
approach the confines of more sober history, and finally, in the reign
of his father, Saint Ferdinand, fairly settle upon its sure and solid
foundations.</p>

<p>The striking characteristic of this remarkable Chronicle is, that,
especially in its Third Part, and in a portion of the Fourth, it is
a translation, if we may so speak, of the old poetical fables and
traditions of the country into a simple, but picturesque, prose,
intended to be sober history. What were the sources of those purely
national passages, which we should be most curious to trace back and
authenticate, we can never know. Sometimes, as in the case of Bernardo
del Carpio and Charlemagne, the ballads and gestes of the olden time<a
id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
are distinctly appealed to. Sometimes, as in the case of the
Children of Lara, an early Latin chronicle, or perhaps some poetical
legend, of which all trace is now lost, may have constituted the
foundations of the narrative.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242"
class="fnanchor">[242]</a> And once at least, if not oftener, an entire
and separate history, that of the Cid, is inserted without being well
fitted into its place. Throughout all these portions, the poetical
character predominates much oftener than it does in the rest; for
while, in the earlier parts, what had been rescued of ancient history
is given with a grave sort of exactness, that renders it dry and
uninteresting, we have in the concluding portion a simple narrative,
where, as in the account of the death of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> Saint Ferdinand, we feel persuaded that
we read touching details sketched by a faithful and affectionate
eyewitness.</p>

<p>Among the more poetical passages are two at the end of the Second
Part, which are introduced, as contrasts to each other, with a degree
of art and skill rare in these simple-hearted old chronicles. They
relate to what was long called “the Ruin of Spain,”<a id="FNanchor_243"
href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> or its conquest
by the Moors, and consist of two picturesque presentments of its
condition before and after that event, which the Spaniards long seemed
to regard as dividing the history of the world into its two great
constituent portions. In the first of these passages, entitled “Of
the Good Things of Spain,”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244"
class="fnanchor">[244]</a> after a few general remarks, the fervent old
chronicler goes on: “For this Spain, whereof we have spoken, is like
the very Paradise of God; for it is watered by five noble rivers, which
are the Duero, and the Ebro, and the Tagus, and the Guadalquivir, and
the Guadiana; and each of these hath, between itself and the others,
lofty mountains and sierras;<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245"
class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and their valleys and plains are great and
broad, and, through the richness of the soil and the watering of the
rivers, they bear many fruits and are full of abundance. And Spain,
above all other things, is skilled in war, feared and very bold in
battle; light of heart, loyal to her lord, diligent in learning,
courtly in speech, accomplished in all good things. Nor is there land
in the world that may be accounted like her in abundance, nor may
any equal her in strength, and few there be in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span> the world so great. And above all doth
Spain abound in magnificence, and more than all is she famous for her
loyalty. O Spain! there is no man can tell of all thy worthiness!”</p>

<p>But now reverse the medal, and look on the other picture, entitled
“The Mourning of Spain,” when, as the Chronicle tells us, after the
victory of the Moors, “all the land remained empty of people, bathed
in tears, a byword, nourishing strangers, deceived of her own people,
widowed and deserted of her sons, confounded among barbarians, worn out
with weeping and wounds, decayed in strength, weakened, uncomforted,
abandoned of all her own.... Forgotten are her songs, and her very
language is become foreign and her words strange.”</p>

<p>The more attractive passages of the Chronicle, however, are its
long narratives. They are also the most poetical;—so poetical, indeed,
that large portions of them, with little change in their phraseology,
have since been converted into popular ballads;<a id="FNanchor_246"
href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> while other portions,
hardly less considerable, are probably derived from similar, but
older, popular poetry, now either wholly lost, or so much changed by
successive oral traditions, that it has ceased to show its relationship
with the chronicling stories to which it originally gave birth.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span> Among these narrative
passages, one of the most happy is the history of Bernardo del Carpio,
for parts of which the Chronicle appeals to ballads more ancient than
itself, while to the whole, as it stands in the Chronicle, ballads
more modern have, in their turn, been much indebted. It is founded on
the idea of a poetical contest between Bernardo’s loyalty to his king,
on the one side, and his attachment to his imprisoned father, on the
other. For he was, as we have already learned from the old ballads and
traditions, the son of a secret marriage between the king’s sister
and the Count de Sandias de Saldaña, which had so offended the king,
that he kept the Count in prison from the time he discovered it, and
concealed whatever related to Bernardo’s birth; educating him meantime
as his own son. When, however, Bernardo grew up, he became the great
hero of his age, rendering important military services to his king
and country. “But yet,” according to the admirably strong expression
of the old Chronicle,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247"
class="fnanchor">[247]</a> “when he knew all this, and that it was
his own father that was in prison, it grieved him to the heart, and
his blood turned in his body, and he went to his house, making the
greatest moan that could be, and put on raiment of mourning, and went
to the King, Don Alfonso. And the king, when he saw it, said to him,
‘Bernardo, do you desire my death?’ for Bernardo until that time had
held himself to be the son of the King, Don Alfonso. And Bernardo said,
‘Sire, I do not wish for your death, but I have great grief, because
my father, the Count of Sandias, lieth in prison, and I beseech you of
your grace that you would command him to be given up to me.’ And the
King, Don Alfonso, when he heard this, said to him, ‘Bernardo, begone
from before me, and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p.
165]</span> be so bold as to speak to me again of this matter; for I
swear to you, that, in all the days that I shall live, you shall never
see your father out of his prison.’ And Bernardo said to him, ‘Sire,
you are my king, and may do whatsoever you shall hold for good, but
I pray God that he will put it into your heart to take him thence;
nevertheless, I, Sire, shall in no wise cease to serve you in all that
I may.’”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this refusal, however, when great services are
wanted from Bernardo in troubled times, his father’s liberty is
promised him as a reward; but these promises are constantly broken,
until he renounces his allegiance, and makes war upon his false uncle,
and on one of his successors, Alfonso the Great.<a id="FNanchor_248"
href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> At last, Bernardo
succeeds in reducing the royal authority so low, that the king again,
and more solemnly, promises to give up his prisoner, if Bernardo, on
his part, will give up the great castle of Carpio, which had rendered
him really formidable. The faithful son does not hesitate, and the
king sends for the Count, but finds him dead, probably by the royal
procurement. The Count’s death, however, does not prevent the base
monarch from determining to keep the castle, which was the stipulated
price of his prisoner’s release. He therefore directs the dead body to
be brought, as if alive, on horseback, and, in company with Bernardo,
who has no suspicion of the cruel mockery, goes out to meet it.</p>

<p>“And when they were all about to meet,” the old Chronicle goes on,
“Bernardo began to shout aloud with great joy, and to say, ‘Cometh
indeed the Count Don Sandias de Saldaña!’ And the King, Don Alfonso,
said to him, ‘Behold where he cometh! Go, therefore, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> salute him whom you have
sought so much to behold.’ And Bernardo went towards him, and kissed
his hand; but when he found it cold, and saw that all his color was
black, he knew that he was dead; and with the grief he had from it,
he began to cry aloud and to make great moan, saying, ‘Alas! Count
Sandias, in an evil hour was I born, for never was man so lost as I am
now for you; for, since you are dead, and my castle is gone, I know
no counsel by which I may do aught.’ And some say in their ballads
(<i>cantares de gesta</i>) that the king then said, ‘Bernardo, now is not
the time for much talking, and therefore I bid you go straightway forth
from my land,’” etc.</p>

<p>This constitutes one of the most interesting parts of the old
General Chronicle: but the whole is curious, and much of it is rich
and picturesque. It is written with more freedom and less exactness
of style than some of the other works of its noble author; and in the
last division shows a want of finish, which in the first two parts is
not perceptible, and in the third only slightly so. But everywhere
it breathes the spirit of its age, and, when taken together, is not
only the most interesting of the Spanish chronicles, but the most
interesting of all that, in any country, mark the transition from its
poetical and romantic traditions to the grave exactness of historical
truth.</p>

<p>The next of the early chronicles that claims our notice is the one
called, with primitive simplicity, “The Chronicle of the Cid”; in some
respects as important as the one we have just examined; in others,
less so. The first thing that strikes us, when we open it, is, that,
although it has much of the appearance and arrangement of a separate
and independent work, it is substantially the same with the two
hundred and eighty pages which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p.
167]</span> constitute the first portion of the Fourth Book of the
General Chronicle of Spain; so that one must certainly have been
taken from the other, or both from some common source. The latter is,
perhaps, the more obvious conclusion, and has sometimes been adopted;<a
id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> but,
on a careful examination, it will probably be found that the Chronicle
of the Cid is rather taken from that of Alfonso the Wise, than from any
materials common to both and older than both. For, in the first place,
each, in the same words, often claims to be a translation from the same
authors; yet, as the language of both is frequently identical for pages
together, this cannot be true, unless one copied from the other. And,
secondly, the Chronicle of the Cid, in some instances, corrects the
errors of the General Chronicle, and in one instance at least makes an
addition to it of a date later than that of the Chronicle itself.<a
id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> But,
passing over the details of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p.
168]</span> this obscure, but not unimportant, point, it is sufficient
for our present purpose to say, that the Chronicle of the Cid is the
same in substance with the history of the Cid in the General Chronicle,
and was probably taken from it.</p>

<p>When it was arranged in its present form, or by whom this was
done, we have no notice.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
class="fnanchor">[251]</a> But it was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span> found, as we now read it, at Cardenas, in
the very monastery where the Cid lies buried, and was seen there by the
youthful Ferdinand, great-grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella, who was
afterwards emperor of Germany, and who was induced to give the abbot
an order to have it printed.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252"
class="fnanchor">[252]</a> This was done accordingly in 1512, since
which time there have been but two editions of it, those of 1552 and of
1593, until it was reprinted in 1844, at Marburg, in Germany, with an
excellent critical preface in Spanish, by Huber.</p>

<p>As a part of the General Chronicle of Spain,<a id="FNanchor_253"
href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> we must, with a little
hesitation, pronounce the Chronicle of the Cid less interesting than
several of the portions that immediately precede it. But still, it is
the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span> national
version of the achievements of the great national hero who freed the
fourth part of his native land from the loathed intrusion of the Moors,
and who stands to this day connected with the proudest recollections
of Spanish glory. It begins with the Cid’s first victories under
Ferdinand the Great, and therefore only alludes to his early youth, and
to the extraordinary circumstances on which Corneille, following the
old Spanish play and ballads, has founded his tragedy; but it gives
afterwards, with great minuteness, nearly every one of the adventures
that in the older traditions are ascribed to him, down to his death,
which happened in 1099, or rather down to the death of Alfonso the
Sixth, ten years later.</p>

<p>Much of it is as fabulous<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254"
class="fnanchor">[254]</a> as the accounts of Bernardo del Carpio and
the Children of Lara, though perhaps not more so than might be expected
in a work of such a period and such pretensions. Its style, too, is
suited to its romantic character, and is more diffuse and grave than
that of the best narrative portions of the General Chronicle. But
then, on the other hand, it is overflowing with the very spirit of the
times when it was written, and offers us so true a picture of their
generous virtues, as well as their stern violence, that it may well be
regarded as one of the best books in the world, if not the very best,
for studying the real character and manners of the ages of chivalry.
Occasionally there are passages in it like the following description
of the Cid’s feelings and conduct, when he left his good castle of
Bivar, unjustly and cruelly exiled by the king,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> which, whether invented or not, are as
true to the spirit of the period they represent, as if the minutest of
their details were ascertained facts.</p>

<p>“And when he saw his courts deserted and without people, and the
perches without falcons, and the gateway without its judgment-seats,
he turned himself toward the East and knelt down and said, ‘Saint
Mary, Mother, and all other Saints, graciously beseech God that he
would grant me might to overcome all these pagans, and that I may
gain from them wherewith to do good to my friends, and to all those
that may follow and help me.’ And then he went on and asked for Alvar
Fañez, and said to him, ‘Cousin, what fault have the poor in the wrong
that the king has done us? Warn all my people, then, that they harm
none, wheresoever we may go.’ And he called for his horse to mount.
Then spake up an old woman standing at her door and said, ‘Go on
with good luck, for you shall make spoil of whatsoever you may find
or desire.’ And the Cid, when he heard that saying, rode on, for he
would tarry no longer; and as he went out of Bivar, he said, ‘Now
do I desire you should know, my friends, that it is the will of God
that we should return to Castile with great honor and great gain.’”<a
id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Some of the touches of manners in this little passage,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span> such as the allusion to
the judgment-seats at his gate, where the Cid in patriarchal simplicity
had administered justice to his vassals, and the hint of the poor
augury gathered from the old woman’s wish, which seems to be of more
power with him than the prayer he had just uttered, or the bold hopes
that were driving him to the Moorish frontiers,—such touches give life
and truth to this old chronicle, and bring its times and feelings, as
it were, sensibly before us. Adding its peculiar treasures to those
contained in the rest of the General Chronicle, we shall find, in the
whole, nearly all the romantic and poetical fables and adventures that
belong to the earliest portions of Spanish history. At the same time,
we shall obtain a living picture of the state of manners in that dark
period, when the elements of modern society were just beginning to be
separated from the chaos in which they had long struggled, and out
of which, by the action of successive ages, they have been gradually
wrought into those forms of policy which now give stability to
governments and peace to the intercourse of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> idea of Alfonso the Wise, simply
and nobly expressed in the opening of his Chronicle, that he was
desirous to leave for posterity a record of what Spain had been and
had done in all past time,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a> was not without influence upon the nation,
even in the state in which it then was, and in which, for above a
century afterwards, it continued. But, as in the case of that great
king’s project for a uniform administration of justice by a settled
code, his example was too much in advance of his age to be immediately
followed; though, as in that memorable case, when it was once adopted,
its fruits became abundant. The two next kings, Sancho the Brave and
Ferdinand the Fourth, took no measures, so far as we know, to keep up
and publish the history of their reigns. But Alfonso the Eleventh,
the same monarch, it should be remembered, under whom the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span> “Partidas” became the
law of the land, recurred to the example of his wise ancestor, and
ordered the annals of the kingdom to be continued, from the time when
those of the General Chronicle ceased down to his own; embracing, of
course, the reigns of Alfonso the Wise, Sancho the Brave, and Ferdinand
the Fourth, or the period from 1252 to 1312.<a id="FNanchor_257"
href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> This is the first
instance of the appointment of a royal chronicler, and may, therefore,
be regarded as the creation of an office of consequence in all that
regards the history of the country, and which, however much it may have
been neglected in later times, furnished important documents down to
the reign of Charles the Fifth, and was continued, in form at least,
till the establishment of the Academy of History in the beginning of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>By whom this office was first filled does not appear; but the
Chronicle itself seems to have been prepared about the year 1320.
Formerly it was attributed to Fernan Sanchez de Tovar; but Fernan
Sanchez was a personage of great consideration and power in the state,
practised in public affairs, and familiar with their history, so that
we can hardly attribute to him the mistakes with which this Chronicle
abounds, especially in the part relating to Alfonso the Wise.<a
id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> But,
whoever may have been its author, the Chronicle, which, it may be
noticed, is so distinctly divided into the three reigns, that it is
rather three chronicles than one, has little value as a composition.
Its narrative is given with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p.
175]</span> rude and dry formality, and whatever interest it awakens
depends, not upon its style and manner, but upon the character of the
events recorded, which sometimes have an air of adventure about them
belonging to the elder times, and, like them, are picturesque.</p>

<p>The example of regular chronicling, having now been fairly set at
the court of Castile, was followed by Henry the Second, who commanded
his Chancellor and Chief-Justiciary, Juan Nuñez de Villaizan, to
prepare, as we are told in the Preface, in imitation of the ancients,
an account of his father’s reign. In this way, the series goes on
unbroken, and now gives us the “Chronicle of Alfonso the Eleventh,”<a
id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
beginning with his birth and education, of which the notices are
slight, but relating amply the events from the time he came to the
throne, in 1312, till his death in 1350. How much of it was actually
written by the chancellor of the kingdom cannot be ascertained.<a
id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
From different passages, it seems that an older chronicle was used
freely in its composition;<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261"
class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and the whole should, therefore, probably be
regarded as a compilation made under the responsibility of the highest
personages of the realm. Its opening will show at once the grave and
measured tone it takes, and the accuracy it claims for its dates and
statements.</p>

<p>“God is the beginning and the means and the end of all things;
and without him they cannot subsist. For by his power they are made,
and by his wisdom ordered, and by his goodness maintained. And he
is the Lord; and, in all things, almighty, and conqueror in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> all battles. Wherefore,
whosoever would begin any good work should first name the name of God,
and place him before all things, asking and beseeching of his mercy
to give him knowledge and will and power, whereby he may bring it to
a good end. Therefore will this pious chronicle henceforward relate
whatsoever happened to the noble King, Don Alfonso, of Castile and
Leon, and the battles and conquests and victories that he had and
did in his life against Moors and against Christians. And it will
begin in the fifteenth year of the reign of the most noble King,
Don Fernando, his father.”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262"
class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The reign of the father, however, occupies only three short
chapters; after which, the rest of the Chronicle, containing in all
three hundred and forty-two chapters, comes down to the death of
Alfonso, who perished of the plague before Gibraltar, and then abruptly
closes. Its general tone is grave and decisive, like that of a person
speaking with authority upon matters of importance, and it is rare that
we find in it a sketch of manners like the following account of the
young king at the age of fourteen or fifteen.</p>

<p>“And as long as he remained in the city of Valladolid, there were
with him knights and esquires, and his tutor, Martin Fernandez de
Toledo, that brought him up, and that had been with him a long time,
even before the queen died, and other men, who had long been used to
palaces, and to the courts of kings; and all these gave him an ensample
of good manners. And, moreover, he had been brought up with the
children of men of note, and with noble knights. But the king, of his
own condition, was well-mannered in eating, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span> drank little, and was clad as became his
estate; and in all other his customs he was well conditioned, for his
speech was true Castilian, and he hesitated not in what he had to say.
And so long as he was in Valladolid, he sat three days in the week to
hear the complaints and suits that came before him; and he was shrewd
in understanding the facts thereof, and he was faithful in secret
matters, and loved them that served him, each after his place, and
trusted truly and entirely those whom he ought to trust. And he began
to be much given to horsemanship, and pleased himself with arms, and
loved to have in his household strong men, that were bold and of good
conditions. And he loved much all his own people, and was sore grieved
at the great mischief and great harm there were in the land through
failure of justice, and he had indignation against evil-doers.”<a
id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>But though there are few sketches in the Chronicle of Alfonso
the Eleventh like the preceding, we find in general a well-ordered
account of the affairs of that monarch’s long and active reign, given
with a simplicity and apparent sincerity which, in spite of the
formal plainness of its style, make it almost always interesting, and
sometimes amusing.</p>

<p>The next considerable attempt approaches somewhat nearer to proper
history. It is the series of chronicles relating to the troublesome
reigns of Peter the Cruel and Henry the Second, to the hardly less
unsettled times of John the First, and to the more quiet and prosperous
reign of Henry the Third. They were written by Pedro Lopez de Ayala,
in some respects the first Spaniard of his age; distinguished, as
we have seen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span>
among the poets of the latter part of the fourteenth century, and
now to be noticed as the best prose-writer of the same period.
He was born in 1332,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"
class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and, though only eighteen years old when
Peter ascended the throne, was soon observed and employed by that
acute monarch. But when troubles arose in the kingdom, Ayala left his
tyrannical master, who had already shown himself capable of almost
any degree of guilt, and joined his fortunes to those of Henry of
Trastamara, the king’s illegitimate brother, who had, of course,
no claim to the throne but such as was laid in the crimes of its
possessor, and the good-will of the suffering nobles and people.</p>

<p>At first, the cause of Henry was successful. But Peter addressed
himself for help to Edward the Black Prince, then in his duchy
of Aquitaine, who, as Froissart relates, thinking it would be
a great prejudice against the estate royal<a id="FNanchor_265"
href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> to have a usurper
succeed, entered Spain, and, with a strong hand, replaced the
fallen monarch on his throne. At the decisive battle of Naxera,
by which this was achieved, in 1367, Ayala, who bore his prince’s
standard, was taken prisoner<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266"
class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and carried to England, where he wrote a
part at least of his poems on a courtly life. Somewhat later, Peter,
no longer supported by the Black Prince, was dethroned; and Ayala,
who was then released from his tedious imprisonment, returned home,
and afterwards became Grand-Chancellor to Henry the Second, in whose
service he gained so much consideration and influence, that he seems
to have descended as a sort of traditionary<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span> minister of state through the reign
of John the First, and far into that of Henry the Third. Sometimes,
indeed, like other grave personages, ecclesiastical as well as civil,
he appeared as a military leader, and once again, in the disastrous
battle of Aljubarrota, in 1385, he was taken prisoner. But his
Portuguese captivity does not seem to have been so long or so cruel
as his English one; and, at any rate, the last years of his life were
passed quietly in Spain. He died at Calahorra in 1407, seventy-five
years old.</p>

<p>“He was,” says his nephew, the noble Fernan Perez de Guzman, in
the striking gallery of portraits he has left us,<a id="FNanchor_267"
href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> “He was a man of very
gentle qualities and of good conversation; had a great conscience and
feared God much. He loved knowledge, also, and gave himself much to
reading books and histories; and though he was as goodly a knight as
any, and of great discretion in the practices of the world, yet he
was by nature bent on learning, and spent a great part of his time in
reading and studying, not books of law, but of philosophy and history.
Through his means some books are now known in Castile that were not
known aforetime; such as Titus Livius, who is the most notable of the
Roman historians; the ‘Fall of Princes’; the ‘Ethics’ of Saint Gregory;
Isidorus ‘De Summo Bono’; Boethius; and the ‘History of Troy.’ He
prepared the History of Castile from the King Don Pedro to the King Don
Henry; and made a good book on Hunting, which he greatly affected, and
another called ‘Rimado de Palacio.’”</p>

<p>We should not, perhaps, at the present day, claim so much reputation
as his kinsman does for the Chancellor<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span> Ayala, in consequence of the interest
he took in books of such doubtful value as Guido de Colonna’s “Trojan
War,” and Boccaccio “De Casibus Principum,” but, in translating Livy,<a
id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> he
unquestionably rendered his country an important service. He rendered,
too, a no less important service to himself; since a familiarity with
Livy tended to fit him for the task of preparing the Chronicle, which
now constitutes his chief distinction and merit.<a id="FNanchor_269"
href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It begins in 1350,
where that of Alfonso the Eleventh ends, and comes down to the sixth
year of Henry the Third, or to 1396, embracing that portion of the
author’s own life which was between his eighteenth year and his
sixty-fourth, and constituting the first safe materials for the history
of his native country.</p>

<p>For such an undertaking Ayala was singularly well fitted. Spanish
prose was already well advanced in his time; for Don John Manuel,
the last of the elder school of good writers, did not die till Ayala
was fifteen years old. He was, moreover, as we have seen, a scholar,
and, for the age in which he lived, a remarkable one; and, what is of
more importance than either of these circumstances, he was personally
familiar with the course of public affairs during the forty-six years
embraced by his Chronicle. Of all this traces are to be found in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span> his work. His style is
not, like that of the oldest chroniclers, full of a rich vivacity and
freedom; but, without being over-carefully elaborated, it is simple
and business-like; while, to give a more earnest air, if not an air
of more truth to the whole, he has, in imitation of Livy, introduced
into the course of his narrative set speeches and epistles intended
to express the feelings and opinions of his principal actors more
distinctly than they could be expressed by the mere facts and current
of the story. Compared with the Chronicle of Alfonso the Wise, which
preceded it by above a century, it lacks the charm of that poetical
credulity which loves to deal in doubtful traditions of glory, rather
than in those ascertained facts which are often little honorable either
to the national fame or to the spirit of humanity. Compared with the
Chronicle of Froissart, with which it was contemporary, we miss the
honest-hearted, but somewhat childlike, enthusiasm that looks with
unmingled delight and admiration upon all the gorgeous phantasmagoria
of chivalry, and find, instead of it, the penetrating sagacity of an
experienced statesman, who looks quite through the deeds of men, and,
like Comines, thinks it not at all worth while to conceal the great
crimes with which he has been familiar, if they can be but wisely and
successfully set forth. When, therefore, we read Ayala’s Chronicle, we
do not doubt that we have made an important step in the progress of the
species of writing to which it belongs, and that we are beginning to
approach the period when history is to teach with sterner exactness the
lesson it has learned from the hard experience of the past.</p>

<p>Among the many curious and striking passages in Ayala’s Chronicle,
the most interesting are, perhaps, those that relate to the unfortunate
Blanche of Bour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span>bon,
the young and beautiful wife of Peter the Cruel, who, for the sake of
María de Padilla, forsook her two days after his marriage, and, when he
had kept her long in prison, at last sacrificed her to his base passion
for his mistress; an event which excited, as we learn from Froissart’s
Chronicle, a sensation of horror, not only in Spain, but throughout
Europe, and became an attractive subject for the popular poetry of the
old national ballads, several of which we find were devoted to it.<a
id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> But
it may well be doubted whether even the best of the ballads give us
so near and moving a picture of her cruel sufferings as Ayala does,
when, going on step by step in his passionless manner, he shows us
the queen first solemnly wedded in the church at Toledo, and then
pining in her prison at Medina Sidonia; the excitement of the nobles,
and the indignation of the king’s own mother and family; carrying
us all the time with painful exactness through the long series of
murders and atrocities by which Pedro at last reaches the final crime
which, during eight years, he had hesitated to commit. For there is,
in the succession of scenes he thus exhibits to us, a circumstantial
minuteness which is above all power of generalization, and brings
the guilty monarch’s character more vividly before us than it could
be brought by the most fervent spirit of poetry or of eloquence.<a
id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> And
it is precisely this cool and patient minuteness of the chronicler,
founded on his personal knowledge, that gives its peculiar character
to Ayala’s record of the four wild reigns in which he lived; pre<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span>senting them to us in a
style less spirited and vigorous, indeed, than that of some of the
older chronicles of the monarchy, but certainly in one more simple,
more judicious, and more effective for the true purposes of history.<a
id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>The last of the royal chronicles that it is necessary to notice
with much particularity is that of John the Second, which begins
with the death of Henry the Third, and comes down to the death of
John himself, in 1454.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273"
class="fnanchor">[273]</a> It was the work of several hands, and
contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> internal
evidence of having been written at different periods. Alvar Garcia
de Santa María, no doubt, prepared the account of the first fourteen
years, or to 1420, constituting about one third of the whole work;<a
id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
after which, in consequence perhaps of his attachment to the
Infante Ferdinand, who was regent during the minority of the
king, and subsequently much disliked by him, his labors ceased.<a
id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
Who wrote the next portion is not known;<a id="FNanchor_276"
href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> but from about 1429
to 1445, John de Mena, the leading poet of his time, was the royal
annalist, and, if we are to trust the letters of one of his friends,
seems to have been diligent in collecting materials for his task, if
not earnest in all its duties.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277"
class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Other parts have been attributed to Juan
Rodriguez del Padron, a poet, and Diego de Valera,<a id="FNanchor_278"
href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> a knight and gentleman
often men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>tioned in
the Chronicle itself, and afterwards himself employed as a chronicler
by Queen Isabella.</p>

<p>But whoever may have been at first concerned in it, the whole
work was ultimately committed to Fernan Perez de Guzman, a scholar,
a courtier, and an acute as well as a witty observer of manners, who
survived John the Second, and probably arranged and completed the
Chronicle of his master’s reign, as it was published by order of the
Emperor Charles the Fifth;<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279"
class="fnanchor">[279]</a> some passages having been added as late as
the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, who are more than once alluded to
in it as reigning sovereigns.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280"
class="fnanchor">[280]</a> It is divided, like the Chronicle of Ayala,
which may naturally have been its model, into the different years of
the king’s reign, each year being subdivided into chapters; and it
contains a great number of important original letters and other curious
contemporary documents,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281"
class="fnanchor">[281]</a> from which, as well as from the care used
in its compilation, it has been considered more absolutely trustworthy
than any Castilian chronicle that preceded it.<a id="FNanchor_282"
href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>In its general air, there is a good deal to mark the manners
of the age, such as accounts of the court ceremonies, festivals,
and tournaments that were so much loved by John; and its style,
though, on the whole, un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p.
186]</span>ornamented and unpretending, is not wanting in variety,
spirit, and solemnity. Once, on occasion of the fall and ignominious
death of the Great Constable Alvaro de Luna, whose commanding spirit
had, for many years, impressed itself on the affairs of the kingdom,
the honest chronicler, though little favorable to that haughty
minister, seems unable to repress his feelings, and, recollecting
the treatise on the “Fall of Princes,” which Ayala had made known in
Spain, breaks out, saying: “O John Boccaccio, if thou wert now alive,
thy pen surely would not fail to record the fall of this strenuous and
bold gentleman among those of the mighty princes whose fate thou hast
set forth. For what greater example could there be to every estate?
what greater warning? what greater teaching to show the revolutions
and movements of deceitful and changing fortune? O blindness of the
whole race of man! O unexpected fall in the affairs of this our world!”
And so on through a chapter of some length.<a id="FNanchor_283"
href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But this is the only
instance of such an outbreak in the Chronicle. On the contrary, its
general tone shows, that historical composition in Spain was about
to undergo a permanent change; for, at its very outset, we have
regular speeches attributed to the principal personages it records,<a
id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> such
as had been introduced by Ayala; and, through the whole, a well-ordered
and documentary record of affairs, tinged, no doubt, with some of
the prejudices and passions of the troublesome times to which it
relates, but still claiming to have the exactness of regular annals,
and striving to reach the grave and dignified style suited to the
higher purposes of history.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285"
class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span>Of the disturbed
and corrupt reign of Henry the Fourth, who, at one period, was nearly
driven from his throne by his younger brother, Alfonso, we have two
chronicles: the first by Diego Enriquez de Castillo, who was attached,
both as chaplain and historiographer, to the person of the legitimate
sovereign; and the other by Alonso de Palencia, chronicler to the
unfortunate pretender, whose claims were sustained only three years,
though the Chronicle of Palencia, like that of Castillo, extends
over the whole period of the regular sovereign’s reign, from 1454 to
1474. They are as unlike each other as the fates of the princes they
record. The Chronicle of Castillo is written with great plainness
of manner, and, except in a few moral reflections, chiefly at the
beginning and the end, seems to aim at nothing but the simplest and
even the driest narrative;<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286"
class="fnanchor">[286]</a> while<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> the Chronicle of Palencia, who had
been educated in Italy under the Greeks recently arrived there from
the ruins of the Eastern Empire, is in a false and cumbrous style;
a single sentence frequently stretching through a chapter, and the
whole work showing that he had gained little but affectation and bad
taste under the teachings of John Lascaris and George of Trebizond.<a
id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Both
works, however, are too strictly annals to be read for any thing but
the facts they contain.</p>

<p>Similar remarks must be made about the chronicles of the reign
of Ferdinand and Isabella, extending from 1474 to 1504-16. There
are several of them, but only two need be noticed. One is by Andres
Bernaldez, often called “El Cura de los Palacios,” because he was
curate in the small town of that name, though the materials for his
Chronicle were, no doubt, gathered chiefly in Seville, the neighbouring
splendid capital of Andalusia, to whose princely Archbishop he was
chaplain. His Chronicle, written, it should seem, chiefly to please
his own taste, extends from 1488 to 1513. It is honest and sincere,
reflecting faithfully the physiognomy of his age; its credulity,
its bigotry, and its love of show. It is, in truth, such an account
of passing events as would be given by one who was rather curious
about them than a part of them; but who, from accident, was familiar
with whatever was going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p.
189]</span> among the leading spirits of his time and country.<a
id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
No portion of it is more valuable and interesting than that which
relates to Columbus, to whom he devotes thirteen chapters, and for
whose history he must have had excellent materials, since not only was
Deza, the Archbishop, to whose service he was attached, one of the
friends and patrons of Columbus, but Columbus himself, in 1496, was
a guest at the house of Bernaldez, and intrusted to him manuscripts
which, he says, he has employed in this very account; thus placing
his Chronicle among the documents important alike in the history
of America and of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289"
class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The other chronicle of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella is that
of Fernando del Pulgar, their Councillor of State, their Secretary,
and their authorized Annalist. He was a person of much note in his
time, but it is not known when he was born or where he died.<a
id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
That he was a man of wit and letters, and an acute observer of
life, we know from his notices of the Famous Men of Castile; from
his Commentary on the Coplas of Mingo Revulgo; and from a few
spirited and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span>
pleasant letters to his friends that have been spared to us. But
as a chronicler his merit is inconsiderable.<a id="FNanchor_291"
href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The early part of
his work is not trustworthy, and the latter part, beginning in 1482
and ending in 1490, is brief in its narrative, and tedious in the
somewhat showy speeches with which it is burdened. The best of it is
its style, which is often dignified; but it is the style of history,
rather than that of a chronicle; and, indeed, the formal division
of the work, according to its subjects, into three parts, as well
as the philosophical reflections with which it is adorned, show
that the ancients had been studied by its author, and that he was
desirous to imitate them.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292"
class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Why he did not continue his account beyond
1490, we cannot tell. It has been conjectured that he died then.<a
id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> But
this is a mistake, for we have a well-written and curious report, made
by him to the queen, on the whole Moorish history of Granada, after the
capture of the city in 1492.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294"
class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The Chronicle of Ferdinand and Isabella by Pulgar is the last
instance of the old style of chronicling that should now be noticed;
for though, as we have already observed, it was long thought for the
dignity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span>
monarchy that the stately forms of authorized annals should be kept
up, the free and picturesque spirit that gave them life was no longer
there. Chroniclers were appointed, like Fernan de Ocampo and Mexia; but
the true chronicling style was gone by, not to return.</p>

<p><i>Chronicles of Particular Events.</i>—It should be borne in mind, that
we have thus far traced only the succession of what may be called the
general Spanish chronicles, which, prepared by royal hands or under
royal authority, have set forth the history of the whole country, from
its earliest beginnings and most fabulous traditions, down through
its fierce wars and divisions, to the time when it had, by the final
overthrow of the Moorish power, been settled into a quiet and compact
monarchy. From their subject and character, they are, of course,
the most important, and, generally, the most interesting, works of
the class to which they belong. But, as might be expected from the
influence they exercised and the popularity they enjoyed, they were
often imitated. Many chronicles were written on a great variety of
subjects, and many works in a chronicling style which yet never bore
the name. Most of them are of no value. But to the few that, from
their manner or style, deserve notice we must now turn for a moment,
beginning with those that refer to particular events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span>Two of these
special chronicles relate to occurrences in the reign of John the
Second, and are not only curious in themselves and for their style, but
valuable, as illustrating the manners of the time. The first, according
to the date of its events, is the “Passo Honroso,” or the Passage of
Honor, and is a formal account of a passage at arms which was held
against all comers in 1434, at the bridge of Orbigo, near the city of
Leon, during thirty days, at a moment when the road was thronged with
knights passing for a solemn festival to the neighbouring shrine of
Santiago. The challenger was Suero de Quiñones, a gentleman of rank,
who claimed to be thus emancipated from the service of wearing for a
noble lady’s sake a chain of iron around his neck every Thursday. The
arrangements for this extraordinary tournament were all made under
the king’s authority. Nine champions, <i>mantenedores</i>, we are told,
stood with Quiñones, and at the end of the thirty days it was found
that sixty-eight knights had adventured themselves against his claim;
that six hundred and twenty-seven encounters had taken place; and that
sixty-six lances had been broken;—one knight, an Aragonese, having
been killed, and many wounded, among whom were Quiñones and eight out
of his nine fellow-champions.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295"

spread out in becoming style, by an eyewitness, with a full account of
the ceremonies, both of chivalry and of religion, that accompanied it.
The theory of the whole is, that Quiñones, in acknowledgment of being
prisoner to a noble lady, had, for some time, weekly worn her chains;
and that he was now to ransom himself from this <i>fanciful</i> imprisonment
by the payment of a certain number of <i>real</i> spears broken by him
and his friends in fair fight. All this, to be sure, is fantastic
enough. But the ideas of love, honor, and religion displayed in the
proceedings of the champions,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296"
class="fnanchor">[296]</a> who hear mass devoutly every day, and yet
cannot obtain Christian burial for the Aragonese knight who is killed,
and in the conduct of Quiñones himself, who fasts each Thursday,
partly, it should seem, in honor of the Madonna, and partly in honor
of his lady,—these and other whimsical incongruities are still more
fantastic. They seem, indeed, as we read their record, to be quite
worthy of the admiration expressed for them by Don Quixote in his
argument with the wise canon,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297"
class="fnanchor">[297]</a> but hardly worthy of any other; so that
we are surprised, at first, when we find them specially recorded
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> the contemporary
Chronicle of King John, and filling, long afterwards, a separate
chapter in the graver Annals of Zurita. And yet such a grand
tournament was an important event in the age when it happened, and is
highly illustrative of the contemporary manners.<a id="FNanchor_298"
href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> History and chronicle,
therefore, alike did well to give it a place; and, indeed, down to
the present time, the curious and elaborate record of the details and
ceremonies of the Passo Honroso is of no little value as one of the
best exhibitions that remain to us of the genius of chivalry, and
as quite the best exhibition of what has been considered the most
characteristic of all the knightly institutions.</p>

<p>The other work of the same period to which we have referred gives
us, also, a striking view of the spirit of the times; one less
picturesque, indeed, but not less instructive. It is called “El Seguro
de Tordesillas,” the Pledge or the Truce of Tordesillas, and relates
to a series of conferences held in 1439, between John the Second and
a body of his nobles, headed by his own son, who, in a seditious and
violent manner, interfered in the affairs of the kingdom, in order to
break down the influence of the Constable de Luna.<a id="FNanchor_299"
href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> It receives its
peculiar name from the revolting circumstance, that, even in the
days of the Passo Honroso, and with some of the knights who figured
in that gorgeous show for the parties, true honor was yet sunk so
low in Spain, that none could be found on either side of this great
quarrel,—not even the King or the Prince,—whose<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span> word would be taken as a pledge for the
mere personal safety of those who should be engaged in the discussions
at Tordesillas. It was necessary, therefore, to find some one not
strictly belonging to either party, who, invested with higher powers
and even with supreme military control, should become the depositary
of the general faith, and, exercising an authority limited only by
his own sense of honor, be obeyed alike by the exasperated sovereign
and his rebellious subjects.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300"
class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>This proud distinction was given to Pedro Fernandez de Velasco,
commonly called the Good or Faithful Count Haro; and the “Seguro de
Tordesillas,” prepared by him some time afterwards, shows how honorably
he executed the extraordinary trust. Few historical works can challenge
such absolute authenticity. The documents of the case, constituting the
chief part of it, are spread out before the reader; and what does not
rest on their foundation rests on that word of the Good Count to which
the lives of whatever was most distinguished in the kingdom had just
been fearlessly trusted. As might be expected, its characteristics are
simplicity and plainness, not elegance or eloquence. It is, in fact,
a collection of documents, but it is an interesting and a melancholy
record. The compact that was made led to no permanent good. The Count
soon withdrew, ill at ease, to his own estates; and in less than two
years his unhappy and weak master was assailed anew, and besieged in
Medina del Campo, by his rebellious family and their adherents.<a
id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
After this, we hear little of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p.
197]</span> Count Haro, except that he continued to assist the king
from time to time, in his increasing troubles, until, worn out with
fatigue of body and mind, he retired from the world, and passed the
last ten years of his life in a monastery, which he had himself
founded, and where he died at the age of threescore and ten.<a
id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>Chronicles of Particular Persons.</i>—But while remarkable
<i>events</i>, like the Passage of Arms at Orbigo and the Pledge of
Tordesillas, were thus appropriately recorded, the remarkable <i>men</i> of
the time could hardly fail occasionally to find fit chroniclers.</p>

<p>Pero Niño, Count de Buelna, who flourished between 1379 and 1453,
is the first of them. He was a distinguished naval and military
commander in the reigns of Henry the Third and John the Second; and
his Chronicle is the work of Gutierre Diez de Gamez, who was attached
to his person from the time Pero Niño was twenty-three years old,
and boasted the distinction of being his standard-bearer in many
a rash and bloody fight. A more faithful chronicler, or one more
imbued with knightly qualities, can hardly be found. He may be well
compared to the “Loyal Serviteur,” the biographer of the Chevalier
Bayard; and, like him, not only enjoyed the confidence of his master,
but shared his spirit.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303"
class="fnanchor">[303]</a> His accounts of the education of
Pero Niño,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>
and of the counsels given him by his tutor;<a id="FNanchor_304"
href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> of Pero’s marriage to
his first wife, the lady Constance de Guebara;<a id="FNanchor_305"
href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> of his cruises against
the corsairs and Bey of Tunis;<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306"
class="fnanchor">[306]</a> of the part he took in the war against
England, after the death of Richard the Second, when he commanded an
expedition that made a descent on Cornwall, and, according to his
chronicler, burnt the town of Poole and took Jersey and Guernsey;<a
id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
and finally, of his share in the common war against Granada, which
happened in the latter part of his life and under the leading of the
Constable Alvaro de Luna,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308"
class="fnanchor">[308]</a> are all interesting and curious, and told
with simplicity and spirit. But the most characteristic and amusing
passages of the Chronicle are, perhaps, those that relate, one to Pero
Niño’s gallant visit at Girfontaine, near Rouen, the residence of the
old Admiral of France, and his gay young wife,<a id="FNanchor_309"
href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> and another to the
course of his true love for Beatrice, daughter of the Infante Don
John, the lady who, after much opposition and many romantic dangers,
became his second wife.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310"
class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Unfortunately, we know nothing about the
author of all this entertaining history except what he modestly tells
us in the work itself; but we cannot doubt that he was as loyal in his
life as he claims to be in his true-hearted account of his master’s
adventures and achievements.</p>

<p>Next after Pero Niño’s Chronicle comes that of the Constable Don
Alvaro de Luna, the leading spirit of the reign of John the Second,
almost from the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p.
199]</span> when, yet a child, he appeared as a page at court, in
1408, down to 1453, when he perished on the scaffold, a victim to
his own haughty ambition, to the jealousy of the nobles nearest the
throne, and to the guilty weakness of the king. Who was the author of
the Chronicle is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311"
class="fnanchor">[311]</a> But, from internal evidence, he was
probably an ecclesiastic of some learning, and certainly a retainer
of the Constable, much about his person, and sincerely attached to
him. It reminds us, at once, of the fine old Life of Wolsey by his
Gentleman Usher, Cavendish; for both works were written after the
fall of the great men whose lives they record, by persons who had
served and loved them in their prosperity, and who now vindicated
their memories with a grateful and trusting affection, which often
renders even their style of writing beautiful by its earnestness, and
sometimes eloquent. The Chronicle of the Constable is, of course, the
oldest. It was composed between 1453 and 1460, or about a century
before Cavendish’s Wolsey. It is grave and stately, sometimes too
stately; but there is a great air of reality about it. The account
of the siege of Palenzuela,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312"
class="fnanchor">[312]</a> the striking description of the Constable’s
person and bearing,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313"
class="fnanchor">[313]</a> the scene of the royal visit to the favorite
in his castle at Escalona, with the festivities that followed,<a
id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
and, above all, the minute and painful details of the Constable’s
fall from power, his arrest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p.
200]</span> and death,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315"
class="fnanchor">[315]</a> show the freedom and spirit of an
eyewitness, or, at least, of a person entirely familiar with the whole
matter about which he writes. It is, therefore, among the richest and
most interesting of the old Spanish chronicles, and quite indispensable
to one who would comprehend the troubled spirit of the period to which
it relates; the period known as that of the <i>bandos</i>, or armed feuds,
when the whole country was broken into parties, each in warlike array,
fighting for its own head, but none fully submitting to the royal
authority.</p>

<p>The last of the chronicles of individuals written in the spirit of
the elder times, that it is necessary to notice, is that of Gonzalvo
de Córdova, “the Great Captain,” who flourished from the period
immediately preceding the war of Granada to that which begins the reign
of Charles the Fifth; and who produced an impression on the Spanish
nation hardly equalled since the earlier days of that great Moorish
contest, the cyclus of whose heroes Gonzalvo seems appropriately
to close up. It was about 1526 that the Emperor Charles the Fifth
desired one of the favorite followers of Gonzalvo, Hernan Perez del
Pulgar, to prepare an account of his great captain’s life. A better
person could not easily have been selected. For he is not, as was
long supposed, Fernando del Pulgar, the wit and courtier of the time
of Ferdinand and Isabella.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316"
class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Nor is the work he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> produced the poor and dull Chronicle
of the life of Gonzalvo first printed in 1580, or earlier, and
often attributed to him.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317"
class="fnanchor">[317]</a> But he is that bold knight who, with a few
followers, penetrated to the very centre of Granada, then all in arms,
and, affixing an Ave Maria, with the sign of the cross, to the doors
of the principal mosque, consecrated its massive pile to the service
of Christianity, while Ferdinand and Isabella were still beleaguering
the city without; an heroic adventure, with which his country rang
from side to side at the time, and which has not since been forgotten
either in its ballads or in its popular drama.<a id="FNanchor_318"
href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>As might be expected from the character of its author,—who, to
distinguish him from the courtly and peaceful Pulgar, was well called
“He of the Achievements,” <i>El de las Hazañas</i>,—the book he offered
to his monarch is not a regular life of Gonzalvo, but rath<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span>er a rude and vigorous
sketch of him, entitled “A Small Part of the Achievements of that
Excellent Person called the Great Captain,” or, as is elsewhere yet
more characteristically said, “of the achievements and solemn virtues
of the Great Captain, both in peace and war.”<a id="FNanchor_319"
href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The modesty of the
author is as remarkable as his adventurous spirit. He is hardly seen
at all in his narrative, while his love and devotion to his great
leader give a fervor to his style, which, notwithstanding a frequent
display of very unprofitable learning, renders his work both curious
and striking, and brings out his hero in the sort of bold relief in
which he appeared to the admiration of his contemporaries. Some parts
of it, notwithstanding its brevity, are remarkable even for the details
they afford; and some of the speeches, like that of the Alfaquí to the
distracted parties in Granada,<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320"
class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and that of Gonzalvo to the population
of the Abbaycin,<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321"
class="fnanchor">[321]</a> savor of eloquence as well as wisdom.
Regarded as the outline of a great man’s character, few sketches have
more an air of truth; though, perhaps, considering the adventurous and
warlike lives both of the author and his subject, nothing in the book
is more remarkable than the spirit of humanity that pervades it.<a
id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>Chronicles of Travels.</i>—In the same style with
the histories of their kings and great men, a few works should be
noticed in the nature of travels, or histories<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span> of travellers, though not always bearing
the name of Chronicles.</p>

<p>The oldest of them, which has any value, is an account of a Spanish
embassy to Tamerlane, the great Tartar potentate and conqueror. Its
origin is curious. Henry the Third of Castile, whose affairs, partly in
consequence of his marriage with Catherine, daughter of Shakspeare’s
“time-honored Lancaster,” were in a more fortunate and quiet condition
than those of his immediate predecessors, seems to have been smitten
in his prosperity with a desire to extend his fame to the remotest
countries of the earth; and for this purpose, we are told, sought to
establish friendly relations with the Greek Emperor at Constantinople,
with the Sultan of Babylon, with Tamerlane or Timour Bec the Tartar,
and even with the fabulous Prester John of that shadowy India which was
then the subject of so much speculation.</p>

<p>What was the result of all this widely spread diplomacy, so
extraordinary at the end of the fourteenth century, we do not know,
except that the first ambassadors sent to Tamerlane and Bajazet
chanced actually to be present at the great and decisive battle
between those two preponderating powers of the East, and that
Tamerlane sent a splendid embassy in return, with some of the spoils
of his victory, among which were two fair captives, who figure in the
Spanish poetry of the time.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323"
class="fnanchor">[323]</a> King Henry was not ungrateful for such a
tribute of respect, and, to acknowledge it, despatched to Tamerlane
three persons of his court, one of whom, Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo,
has left us a minute account of the whole embassy, its adventures
and its results.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span>
This account was first published by Argote de Molina, the careful
antiquary of the time of Philip the Second,<a id="FNanchor_324"
href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and was then called,
probably in order to give it a more winning title, “The Life of the
Great Tamerlane,”—<i>Vida del Gran Tamurlan</i>,—though it is, in fact,
a diary of the voyagings and residences of the ambassadors of Henry
the Third, beginning in May, 1403, when they embarked at Puerto Santa
María, near Cadiz, and ending in March, 1406, when they landed there on
their return.</p>

<p>In the course of it, we have a description of Constantinople,
which is the more curious because it is given at the moment when
it tottered to its fall;<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325"
class="fnanchor">[325]</a> of Trebizond, with its Greek
churches and clergy;<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326"
class="fnanchor">[326]</a> of Teheran, now the capital of Persia;<a
id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
and of Samarcand, where they found the great Conqueror himself,
and were entertained by him with a series of magnificent festivals
continuing almost to the moment of his death,<a id="FNanchor_328"
href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> which happened while
they were at his court, and was followed by troubles embarrassing
to their homeward journey.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329"
class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The honest Clavijo seems to have been well
pleased to lay down his commission at the feet of his sovereign, whom
he found at Alcalá; and though he lingered about the court for a year,
and was one of the witnesses of the king’s will at Christmas, yet on
the death of Henry he retired to Madrid, his native place, where he
spent the last four or five years of his life,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span> and where, in 1412, he was buried
in the convent of Saint Francis, with his fathers, whose chapel
he had piously rebuilt.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330"
class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>His travels will not, on the whole, suffer by a comparison with
those of Marco Polo or Sir John Mandeville; for, though his discoveries
are much less in extent than those of the Venetian merchant, they are,
perhaps, as remarkable as those of the English adventurer, while the
manner in which he has presented them is superior to that of either.
His Spanish loyalty and his Catholic faith are everywhere apparent. He
plainly believes that his modest embassy is making an impression of his
king’s power and importance, on the countless and careless multitudes
of Asia, which will not be effaced; while, in the luxurious capital
of the Greek empire, he seems to look for little but the apocryphal
relics of saints and apostles which then burdened the shrines of
its churches. With all this, however, we may be content, because it
is national; but when we find him filling the island of Ponza with
buildings erected by Virgil,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331"
class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and afterwards, as he passes Amalfi, taking
note of it only because it contained the head of Saint Andrew,<a
id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
we are obliged to recall his frankness, his zeal, and all his other
good qualities, before we can be quite reconciled to his ignorance.
Mariana, indeed, intimates, that, after all, his stories are not to be
wholly believed. But, as in the case of other early travellers, whose
accounts were often discredited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p.
206]</span> merely because they were so strange, more recent and
careful inquiries have confirmed Clavijo’s narrative; and we may now
trust to his faithfulness as much as to the vigilant and penetrating
spirit he shows constantly, except when his religious faith, or
his hardly less religious loyalty, interferes with its exercise.<a
id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>But the great voyagings of the Spaniards were not destined to be
in the East. The Portuguese, led on originally by Prince Henry, one
of the most extraordinary men of his age, had, as it were, already
appropriated to themselves that quarter of the world by discovering
the easy route of the Cape of Good Hope; and, both by the right of
discovery and by the provisions of the well-known Papal bull and
the equally well-known treaty of 1479, had cautiously cut off their
great rivals, the Spaniards, from all adventure in that direction;
leaving open to them only the wearisome waters that were stretched
out unmeasured towards the West. Happily, however, there was one
man to whose courage even the terrors of this unknown and dreaded
ocean were but spurs and incentives, and whose gifted vision, though
sometimes dazzled from the height to which he rose, could yet see,
beyond the waste of waves, that broad continent which his fervent
imagination deemed needful to balance the world. It is true, Columbus
was not born a Spaniard. But his spirit was eminently Spanish. His
loyalty, his religious faith and enthusiasm, his love of great and
extraordinary adventure, were all Spanish rather than Italian, and
were all in harmony with the Spanish national<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span> character, when he became a part of its
glory. His own eyes, he tells us, had watched the silver cross, as it
slowly rose, for the first time, above the towers of the Alhambra,
announcing to the world the final and absolute overthrow of the
infidel power in Spain;<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334"
class="fnanchor">[334]</a> and from that period,—or one even earlier,
when some poor monks from Jerusalem had been at the camp of the
two sovereigns before Granada, praying for help and protection
against the unbelievers in Palestine,—he had conceived the grand
project of consecrating the untold wealth he trusted to find in
his westward discoveries, by devoting it to the rescue of the Holy
City and sepulchre of Christ; thus achieving, by his single power
and resources, what all Christendom and its ages of crusades had
failed to accomplish.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335"
class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Gradually these and other kindred ideas took firm possession of
his mind, and are found occasionally in his later journals, letters,
and speculations, giving to his otherwise quiet and dignified style
a tone elevated and impassioned like that of prophecy. It is true,
that his adventurous spirit, when the mighty mission of his life was
upon him, rose above all this, and, with a purged vision and through a
clearer atmosphere, saw, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p.
208]</span> the outset, what he at last so gloriously accomplished;
but still, as he presses onward, there not unfrequently break from him
words which leave no doubt, that, in his secret heart, the foundations
of his great hopes and purposes were laid in some of the most
magnificent illusions that are ever permitted to fill the human mind.
He believed himself to be, in some degree at least, inspired; and to be
chosen of Heaven to fulfil certain of the solemn and grand prophecies
of the Old Testament.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336"
class="fnanchor">[336]</a> He wrote to his sovereigns in 1501, that
he had been induced to undertake his voyages to the Indies, not by
virtue of human knowledge, but by a Divine impulse, and by the force
of Scriptural prediction.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337"
class="fnanchor">[337]</a> He declared, that the world could not
continue to exist more than a hundred and fifty-five years longer,
and that, many a year before that period, he counted the recovery of
the Holy City to be sure.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338"
class="fnanchor">[338]</a> He expressed his belief, that the
terrestrial paradise, about which he cites the fanciful speculations
of Saint Ambrose and Saint Augustin, would be found in the southern
regions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span> those
newly discovered lands, which he describes with so charming an amenity,
and that the Orinoco was one of the mystical rivers issuing from it;
intimating, at the same time, that, perchance, he alone of mortal
men would, by the Divine will, be enabled to reach and enjoy it.<a
id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> In a
remarkable letter of sixteen pages, addressed to his sovereigns from
Jamaica in 1503, and written with a force of style hardly to be found
in any thing similar at the same period, he gives a moving account of a
miraculous vision, which he believed had been vouchsafed to him for his
consolation, when at Veragua, a few months before, a body of his men,
sent to obtain salt and water, had been cut off by the natives, thus
leaving him outside the mouth of the river in great peril.</p>

<p>“My brother and the rest of the people,” he says, “were in a vessel
that remained within, and I was left solitary on a coast so dangerous,
with a strong fever and grievously worn down. Hope of escape was dead
within me. I climbed aloft with difficulty, calling anxiously and not
without many tears for help upon your Majesties’ captains from all
the four winds of heaven. But none made me answer. Wearied and still
moaning, I fell asleep, and heard a pitiful voice which said: ‘O fool,
and slow to trust and serve thy God, the God of all! What did He
more for Moses, or for David his servant? Ever since thou wast born,
thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span> hast been His
especial charge. When He saw thee at the age wherewith He was content,
He made thy name to sound marvellously on the earth. The Indies, which
are a part of the world, and so rich, He gave them to thee for thine
own, and thou hast divided them unto others as seemed good to thyself,
for He granted thee power to do so. Of the barriers of the great ocean,
which were bound up with such mighty chains, He hath given unto thee
the keys. Thou hast been obeyed in many lands, and thou hast gained
an honored name among Christian men. What did He more for the people
of Israel when He led them forth from Egypt? or for David, whom from
a shepherd He made king in Judea? Turn thou, then, again unto Him,
and confess thy sin. His mercy is infinite. Thine old age shall not
hinder thee of any great thing. Many inheritances hath He, and very
great. Abraham was above a hundred years old when he begat Isaac; and
Sarah, was she young? Thou callest for uncertain help; answer, Who hath
afflicted thee so much and so often? God or the world? The privileges
and promises that God giveth, He breaketh not, nor, after he hath
received service, doth He say that thus was not his mind, and that His
meaning was other. Neither punisheth He, in order to hide a refusal of
justice. What He promiseth, that He fulfilleth, and yet more. And doth
the world thus? I have told thee what thy Maker hath done for thee,
and what He doth for all. Even now He in part showeth thee the reward
of the sorrows and dangers thou hast gone through in serving others.’
All this heard I, as one half dead; but answer had I none to words
so true, save tears for my sins. And whosoever it might be that thus
spake, he ended, saying, ‘Fear not; be of good cheer; all these<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span> thy griefs are written
in marble, and not without cause.’ And I arose as soon as I might, and
at the end of nine days the weather became calm.”<a id="FNanchor_340"
href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>Three years afterwards, in 1506, Columbus died at Valladolid,
a disappointed, broken-hearted old man; little comprehending what
he had done for mankind, and still less the glory and homage that
through all future generations awaited his name.<a id="FNanchor_341"
href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>But the mantle of his devout and heroic spirit fell on none of
his successors. The discoveries of the new continent, which was soon
ascertained to be no part of Asia, were indeed prosecuted with spirit
and success by Balboa, by Vespucci, by Hojeda, by Pedrárias Dávila,
by the Portuguese Magellanes, by Loaisa, by Saavedra, and by many
more; so that in twenty-seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p.
212]</span> years the general outline and form of the New World were,
through their reports, fairly presented to the Old. But though some of
these early adventurers, like Hojeda, were men apparently of honest
principles, who suffered much, and died in poverty and sorrow, yet none
had the lofty spirit of the original discoverer, and none spoke or
wrote with the tone of dignity and authority that came naturally from a
man whose character was so elevated, and whose convictions and purposes
were founded in some of the deepest and most mysterious feelings
of our religious nature.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342"
class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>Romantic Chronicles.</i>—It only remains now to speak of
one other class of the old chronicles; a class hardly represented in
this period by more than a single specimen, but that a very curious
one, and one which, by its date and character, brings us to the end of
our present inquiries, and marks the transition to those that are to
follow. The Chronicle referred to is that called “The Chronicle of Don
Roderic, with the Destruction of Spain,” and is an account, chiefly
fabulous, of the reign of King Roderic, the conquest of the country
by the Moors, and the first attempts to recover it in the beginning
of the eighth century. An edition is cited as early as 1511, and
six in all may be enumerated, including the last, which is of 1587;
thus showing a good degree of popularity, if we consider the number
of readers in Spain in the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_343"
href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span> Its author is quite unknown. According
to the fashion of the times, it professes to have been written by
Eliastras, one of the personages who figures in it; but he is killed
in battle just before we reach the end of the book; and the remainder,
which looks as if it might really be an addition by another hand, is in
the same way ascribed to Carestes, a knight of Alfonso the Catholic.<a
id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Most of the names throughout the work are as imaginary as those of
its pretended authors; and the circumstances related are, generally, as
much invented as the dialogue between its personages, which is given
with a heavy minuteness of detail, alike uninteresting in itself, and
false to the times it represents. In truth, it is hardly more than
a romance of chivalry, founded on the materials for the history of
Roderic and Pelayo, as they still exist in the “General Chronicle of
Spain” and in the old ballads; so that, though we often meet what
is familiar to us about Count Julian, La Cava, and Orpas, the false
Archbishop of Seville, we find ourselves still oftener in the midst
of impossible tournaments<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345"
class="fnanchor">[345]</a> and incredible adventures of chivalry.<a
id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
Kings travel about like knights-errant,<a id="FNanchor_347"
href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and ladies in
distress wander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span>
from country to country,<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348"
class="fnanchor">[348]</a> as they do in “Palmerin of England,” while,
on all sides, we encounter fantastic personages, who were never heard
of anywhere but in this apocryphal Chronicle.<a id="FNanchor_349"
href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>The principle of such a work is, of course, nearly the same with
that of the modern historical romance. What, at the time it was
written, was deemed history was taken as its basis from the old
chronicles, and mingled with what was then the most advanced form of
romantic fiction, just as it has been since in the series of works of
genius beginning with Defoe’s “Memoirs of a Cavalier.” The difference
is in the general representation of manners, and in the execution, both
of which are now immeasurably advanced. Indeed, though Southey has
founded much of his beautiful poem of “Roderic, the Last of the Goths,”
on this old Chronicle, it is, after all, hardly a book that can be
read. It is written in a heavy, verbose style, and has a suspiciously
monkish prologue and conclusion, which look as if the whole were
originally intended to encourage the Romish doctrine of penance, or,
at least, were finally arranged to subserve that devout purpose.<a
id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span></p>

<p>This is the last, and, in many respects, the worst, of the
chronicles of the fifteenth century, and marks but an ungraceful
transition to the romantic fictions of chivalry that were already
beginning to inundate Spain. But as we close it up, we should not
forget, that the whole series, extending over full two hundred and
fifty years, from the time of Alfonso the Wise to the accession of
Charles the Fifth, and covering the New World as well as the Old, is
unrivalled in richness, in variety, and in picturesque and poetical
elements. In truth, the chronicles of no other nation can, on such
points, be compared to them; not even the Portuguese, which approach
the nearest in original and early materials; nor the French, which, in
Joinville and Froissart, make the highest claims in another direction.
For these old Spanish chronicles, whether they have their foundations
in truth or in fable, always strike farther down than those of any
other nation into the deep soil of the popular feeling and character.
The old Spanish loyalty, the old Spanish religious faith, as both
were formed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span>
nourished in the long periods of national trial and suffering, are
constantly coming out; hardly less in Columbus and his followers, or
even amidst the atrocities of the conquests in the New World, than in
the half-miraculous accounts of the battles of Hazinas and Tolosa,
or in the grand and glorious drama of the fall of Granada. Indeed,
wherever we go under their leading, whether to the court of Tamerlane,
or to that of Saint Ferdinand, we find the heroic elements of the
national genius gathered around us; and thus, in this vast, rich mass
of chronicles, containing such a body of antiquities, traditions,
and fables as has been offered to no other people, we are constantly
discovering, not only the materials from which were drawn a multitude
of the old Spanish ballads, plays, and romances, but a mine which has
been unceasingly wrought by the rest of Europe for similar purposes,
and still remains unexhausted.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351"

<p><span class="smcap">Romances of Chivalry.</span>—The ballads of
Spain belonged originally to the whole nation, but especially to its
less cultivated portions. The chronicles, on the contrary, belonged to
the proud and knightly classes, who sought in such picturesque records,
not only the glorious history of their forefathers, but an appropriate
stimulus to their own virtues and those of their children. As, however,
security was gradually extended through the land, and the tendency to
refinement grew stronger, other wants began to be felt. Books were
demanded, that would furnish amusement less popular than that afforded
by the ballads, and excitement less grave than that of the chronicles.
What was asked for was obtained, and probably without difficulty; for
the spirit of poetical invention, which had been already thoroughly
awakened in the country, needed only to be turned to the old traditions
and fables of the early national chronicles, in order to produce
fictions allied to both of them, yet more attractive than either.
There is, in fact, as we can easily see, but a single step be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span>tween large portions of
several of the old chronicles, especially that of Don Roderic, and
proper romances of chivalry.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352"
class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Such fictions, under ruder or more settled forms, had already
existed in Normandy, and perhaps in the centre of France, above two
centuries before they were known in the Spanish peninsula. The story
of Arthur and the Knights of his Round Table had come thither from
Brittany through Geoffrey of Monmouth, as early as the beginning
of the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353"
class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The story of Charlemagne and his Peers,
as it is found in the Chronicle of the fabulous Turpin, had followed
from the South of France soon afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_354"
href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Both were, at first, in
Latin, but both were almost immediately transferred to the French, then
spoken at the courts of Normandy and England, and at once gained a wide
popularity. Robert Wace, born in the island of Jersey, gave in 1158 a
metrical history founded on the work of Geoffrey, which, besides the
story of Arthur, contains a series of traditions concerning the Breton
kings, tracing them up to a fabulous Brutus, the grandson of Æneas.<a
id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> A
century later, or about 1270-1280, after less successful attempts by
others, the same service was rendered to the story of Charlemagne
by Adenés in his metrical romance of “Ogier le Danois,” the chief
scenes of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span>
are laid either in Spain or in Fairy Land.<a id="FNanchor_356"
href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> These, and similar
poetical inventions, constructed out of them by the Trouveurs of the
North, became, in the next age, materials for the famous romances of
chivalry in prose, which, during three centuries, constituted no mean
part of the vernacular literature of France, and, down to our own
times, have been the great mine of wild fables for Ariosto, Spenser,
Wieland, and the other poets of chivalry, whose fictions are connected
either with the stories of Arthur and his Round Table, or with those
of Charlemagne and his Peers.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357"
class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>At the period, however, to which we have alluded, and which ends
about the middle of the fourteenth century, there is no reasonable
pretence that any such form of fiction existed in Spain. There, the
national heroes continued to fill the imaginations of men and satisfy
their patriotism. Arthur was not heard of at all, and Charlemagne, when
he appears in the old Spanish chronicles and ballads, comes only as
that imaginary invader of Spain who sustained an inglorious defeat in
the gorges of the Pyrenees. But in the next century things are entirely
changed. The romances of France, it is plain, have penetrated into
the Peninsula, and their effects are visible. They were not, indeed,
at first, translated or versified; but they were imitated, and a new
series of fictions was invented, which was soon spread through the
world, and became more famous than either of its predecessors.</p>

<p>This extraordinary family of romances, whose de<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span>scendants, as Cervantes
says, were innumerable,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358"
class="fnanchor">[358]</a> is the family of which Amadis is the
poetical head and type. Our first notice of it in Spain is from a
grave statesman, Ayala, the Chronicler and Chancellor of Castile,
who, as we have already seen, died in 1407.<a id="FNanchor_359"
href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> But the Amadis is
of an earlier date than this fact necessarily implies, though not
perhaps earlier known in Spain. Gomez Eannes de Zurara, Keeper of the
Archives of Portugal in 1454, who wrote three striking chronicles
relating to the affairs of his own country, leaves no substantial
doubt that the author of the Amadis of Gaul was Vasco de Lobeira, a
Portuguese gentleman who was attached to the court of John the First
of Portugal, was armed as a knight by that monarch just before the
battle of Aljubarrota, in 1385, and died in 1403.<a id="FNanchor_360"
href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The words of the
honest and careful annalist are quite distinct on this point. He says
he is unwilling to have his true and faithful book, the “Chronicle of
Count Pedro de Meneses,” confounded with such stories as “the book of
Amadis, which was made entirely at the pleasure of one man, called
Vasco de Lobeira, in the time of the King Don Ferdinand; all the things
in the said book being invented by its author.”<a id="FNanchor_361"
href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span>Whether Lobeira
had any older popular tradition or fancies about Amadis, to quicken his
imagination and marshal him the way he should go, we cannot now tell.
He certainly had a knowledge of some of the old French romances, such
as that of the Saint Graal, or Holy Cup,—the crowning fiction of the
Knights of the Round Table,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362"
class="fnanchor">[362]</a>—and distinctly acknowledges himself to
have been indebted to the Infante Alfonso, who was born in 1370, for
an alteration made in the character of Amadis.<a id="FNanchor_363"
href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> But that he was
aided, as has been suggested, in any considerable degree, by fictions
known to have been in Picardy in the eighteenth century, and claimed,
without the slightest proof, to have been there in the twelfth, is an
assumption made on too slight grounds to be seriously considered.<a
id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> We
must therefore conclude, from the few, but plain, facts known in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span> the case, that the Amadis
was originally a Portuguese fiction produced before the year 1400, and
that Vasco de Lobeira was its author.</p>

<p>But the Portuguese original can no longer be found. At the end of
the sixteenth century, we are assured, it was extant in manuscript in
the archives of the Dukes of Arveiro at Lisbon; and the same assertion
is renewed, on good authority, about the year 1750. From this time,
however, we lose all trace of it; and the most careful inquiries render
it probable that this curious manuscript, about which there has been so
much discussion, perished in the terrible earthquake and conflagration
of 1755, when the palace occupied by the ducal family of Arveiro
was destroyed with all its precious contents.<a id="FNanchor_365"
href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The Spanish version, therefore, stands for us in place of
the Portuguese original. It was made between 1492 and 1504, by
Garcia Ordoñez de Montalvo, governor of the city of Medina del
Campo, and it is possible that it was printed for the first time
during the same interval.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366"
class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But no copy of such an edition is known
to exist, nor any one of an edition sometimes cited as having been
printed at Salamanca in 1510;<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367"
class="fnanchor">[367]</a> the earliest<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span> now accessible to us dating from 1519.
Twelve more followed in the course of half a century, so that the
Amadis succeeded, at once, in placing the fortunes of its family on
the sure foundations of popular favor in Spain. It was translated into
Italian in 1546, and was again successful; six editions of it appearing
in that language in less than thirty years.<a id="FNanchor_368"
href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> In France, beginning
with the first attempt in 1540, it became such a favorite, that its
reputation there has not yet wholly faded away;<a id="FNanchor_369"
href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> while, elsewhere in
Europe, a multitude of translations and imitations have followed, that
seem to stretch out the line of the family, as Don Quixote declares,
from the age immediately after the introduction of Christianity
down almost to that in which he himself lived.<a id="FNanchor_370"
href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>The translation of Montalvo does not seem to have been very
literal. It was, as he intimates, much better than the Portuguese in
its style and phraseology; and the last part especially appears to
have been more altered than either of the others.<a id="FNanchor_371"
href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> But the structure
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span> tone of the
whole fiction are original, and much more free than those of the French
romances that had preceded it. The story of Arthur and the Holy Cup
is essentially religious; the story of Charlemagne is essentially
military; and both are involved in a series of adventures previously
ascribed to their respective heroes by chronicles and traditions,
which, whether true or false, were so far recognized as to prescribe
limits to the invention of all who subsequently adopted them. But the
Amadis is of imagination all compact. No period of time is assigned
to its events, except that they begin to occur soon after the very
commencement of the Christian era; and its geography is generally as
unsettled and uncertain as the age when its hero lived. It has no
purpose, indeed, but to set forth the character of a perfect knight,
and to illustrate the virtues of courage and chastity as the only
proper foundations of such a character.</p>

<p>Amadis, in fulfilment of this idea, is the son of a merely imaginary
king of the imaginary kingdom of Gaula. His birth is illegitimate,
and his mother, Elisena, a British princess, ashamed of her child,
exposes him on the sea, where he is found by a Scottish knight, and
carried, first to England, and afterwards to Scotland. In Scotland
he falls in love with Oriana, the true and peerless lady, daughter
of an imaginary Lisuarte, King of England. Meantime, Perion, King of
Gaula, which has sometimes been conjectured to be a part of Wales,
has married the mother of Amadis, who has by him a second son, named
Galaor. The adventures of these two knights, partly in England,
France, Germany, and Turkey, and partly in unknown regions and amidst
enchantments,—sometimes under the favor of their ladies, and sometimes,
as in the hermitage of the Firm Island,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span> under their frowns,—fill up the book,
which, after the broad journeyings of the principal knights, and an
incredible number of combats between them and other knights, magicians,
and giants, ends, at last, in the marriage of Amadis and Oriana, and
the overthrow of all the enchantments that had so long opposed their
love.</p>

<p>The Amadis is admitted, by general consent, to be the best of all
the old romances of chivalry. One reason of this is, that it is more
true to the manners and spirit of the age of knighthood; but the
principal reason is, no doubt, that it is written with a more free
invention, and takes a greater variety in its tones than is found in
other similar works. It even contains, sometimes,—what we should hardly
expect in this class of wild fictions,—passages of natural tenderness
and beauty, such as the following description of the young loves of
Amadis and Oriana.</p>

<p>“Now Lisuarte brought with him to Scotland Brisena, his wife, and
a daughter that he had by her when he dwelt in Denmark, named Oriana,
about ten years old, and the fairest creature that ever was seen; so
fair, that she was called ‘Without Peer,’ since in her time there
was none equal to her. And because she suffered much from the sea,
he consented to leave her there, asking the King, Languines, and his
Queen, that they would have care of her. And they were made very glad
therewith, and the Queen said, ‘Trust me that I will have such a care
of her as her mother would.’ And Lisuarte, entering into his ships,
made haste back into Great Britain, and found there some who had made
disturbances, such as are wont to be in such cases. And for this cause,
he remembered him not of his daughter, for some space of time. But at
last, with much toil that he took, he obtained his kingdom, and he
was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span> best king
that ever was before his time, nor did any afterwards better maintain
knighthood in its rights, till King Arthur reigned, who surpassed
all the kings before him in goodness, though the number that reigned
between these two was great.</p>

<p>“And now the author leaves Lisuarte reigning in peace and quietness
in Great Britain, and turns to the Child of the Sea, [Amadis,] who was
twelve years old, but in size and limbs seemed to be fifteen. He served
before the Queen, and was much loved of her, as he was of all ladies
and damsels. But as soon as Oriana, the daughter of King Lisuarte, came
there, she gave to her the Child of the Sea, that he should serve her,
saying, ‘This is a child who shall serve you.’ And she answered, that
it pleased her. And the child kept this word in his heart, in such wise
that it never afterwards left it; and, as this history truly says, he
was never, in all the days of his life, wearied with serving her. And
this their love lasted as long as they lasted; but the Child of the
Sea, who knew not at all how she loved him, held himself to be very
bold, in that he had placed his thoughts on her, considering both her
greatness and her beauty, and never so much as dared to speak any word
to her concerning it. And she, though she loved him in her heart, took
heed that she should not speak with him more than with another; but her
eyes took great solace in showing to her heart what thing in the world
she most loved.</p>

<p>“Thus lived they silently together, neither saying aught to the
other of their estate. Then came, at last, the time when the Child of
the Sea, as I now tell you, understood within himself that he might
take arms, if any there were that would make him a knight. And this he
desired, because he considered that he should<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span> thus become such a man and should do such
things, as that either he should perish in them, or, if he lived, then
his lady should deal gently with him. And with this desire he went to
the King, who was in his garden, and, kneeling before him, said, ‘Sire,
if it please you, it is now time that I should be made a knight.’ And
the king said, ‘How, Child of the Sea, do you already adventure to
maintain knighthood? Know that it is a light matter to come by it,
but a weighty thing to maintain it. And whoso seeks to get this name
of knighthood and maintain it in its honor, he hath to do so many and
such grievous things, that often his heart is wearied out; and if he
should be such a knight, that, from faint-heartedness or cowardice,
he should fail to do what is beseeming, then it would be better for
him to die than to live in his shame. Therefore I hold it good that
you wait yet a little.’ But the Child of the Sea said to him, ‘Neither
for all this will I fail to be a knight; for, if I had not already
thought to fulfil this that you have said, my heart would not so have
striven to be a knight.’”<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372"
class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>Other passages of quite a different character are no less
striking, as, for instance, that in which the fairy Urganda comes
in her fire-galleys,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373"
class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and that in which the venerable
Nasciano visits Oriana;<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374"
class="fnanchor">[374]</a> but the most characteristic are those
that illustrate the spirit of chivalry, and inculcate the duties
of princes and knights. In these portions of the work, there is
sometimes a lofty tone that rises to eloquence,<a id="FNanchor_375"
href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and sometimes a sad one
full of earnestness and truth.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376"
class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The general story,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span> too, is more simple and effective
than the stories of the old French romances of chivalry. Instead
of distracting our attention by the adventures of a great number
of knights, whose claims are nearly equal, it is kept fastened on
two, whose characters are well preserved;—Amadis, the model of all
chivalrous virtues, and his brother, Don Galaor, hardly less perfect as
a knight in the field, but by no means so faithful in his loves;—and,
in this way, it has a more epic proportion in its several parts, and
keeps up our interest to the end more successfully than any of its
followers or rivals.</p>

<p>The great objection to the Amadis is one that must be made to all of
its class. We are wearied by its length, and by the constant recurrence
of similar adventures and dangers, in which, as we foresee, the hero is
certain to come off victorious. But this length and these repetitions
seemed no fault when it first appeared, or for a long time afterwards.
For romantic fiction, the only form of elegant literature which modern
times have added to the marvellous inventions of Greek genius, was then
recent and fresh; and the few who read for amusement rejoiced even in
the least graceful of its creations, as vastly nearer to the hearts and
thoughts of men educated in the institutions of knighthood than any
glimpses they had thus far caught of the severe glories of antiquity.
The Amadis, therefore,—as we may easily learn by the notices of it
from the time when the great Chancellor of Castile mourned that he had
wasted his leisure over its idle fancies, down to the time when the
whole sect disappeared before the avenging satire of Cervantes,—was
a work of extraordinary popularity in Spain; and one which, during
the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span> centuries
of its greatest favor, was more read than any other book in the
language.</p>

<p>Nor should it be forgotten that Cervantes himself was not
insensible to its merits. The first book that, as he tells us, was
taken from the shelves of Don Quixote, when the curate, the barber,
and the housekeeper began the expurgation of his library, was the
Amadis de Gaula. “‘There is something mysterious about this matter,’
said the curate; ‘for, as I have heard, this was the first book of
knight-errantry that was printed in Spain, and all the others have
had their origin and source here, so that, as the arch-heretic of so
mischievous a sect, I think he should, without a hearing, be condemned
to the fire.’ ‘No, Sir,’ said the barber, ‘for I, too, have heard that
it is the best of all the books of its kind that have been written,
and therefore, for its singularity, it ought to be forgiven.’ ‘That
is the truth,’ answered the curate, ‘and so let us spare it for the
present’”;—a decision which, on the whole, has been confirmed by
posterity, and precisely for the reason Cervantes has assigned.<a

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span></p>

<p>But before Montalvo published his translation of the Amadis, and
perhaps before he had made it, he had written a continuation, which
he announced in the Preface to the Amadis as its fifth book. It is an
original work, about one third part as long as the Amadis, and contains
the story of the son of that hero and Oriana, named Esplandian, whose
birth and education had already been given in the story of his father’s
adventures, and constitute one of its pleasantest episodes. But, as the
curate says, when he comes to this romance in Don Quixote’s library,
“the merits of the father must not be imputed to the son.” The story
of Esplandian has neither freshness, spirit, nor dignity in it. It
opens at the point where he is left in the original fiction, just
armed as a knight, and is filled with his adventures as he wanders
about the world, and with the supernumerary achievements of his
father Amadis, who survives to the end of the whole, and sees his son
made Emperor of Constantinople; he himself having long before become
King of Great Britain by the death of Lisuarte.<a id="FNanchor_378"
href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>But, from the beginning, we find two mistakes committed, which run
through the whole work. Amadis, represented as still alive, fills
a large part of the can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p.
232]</span>vas; while, at the same time, Esplandian is made to perform
achievements intended to be more brilliant than his father’s, but
which, in fact, are only more extravagant. From this sort of emulation,
the work becomes a succession of absurd and frigid impossibilities.
Many of the characters of the Amadis are preserved in it, like
Lisuarte, who is rescued out of a mysterious imprisonment by Esplandian
as his first adventure; Urganda, who, from a graceful fairy, becomes a
savage enchantress; and “the great master Elisabad,” a man of learning
and a priest, whom we first knew as the leech of Amadis, and who is now
the pretended biographer of his son, writing, as he says, in Greek. But
none of them, and none of the characters invented for the occasion, are
managed with skill.</p>

<p>The scene of the whole work is laid chiefly in the East, amidst
battles with Turks and Mohammedans; thus showing to what quarter the
minds of men were turned when it was written, and what were the dangers
apprehended to the peace of Europe, even in its westernmost borders,
during the century after the fall of Constantinople. But all reference
to real history or real geography was apparently thought inappropriate,
as may be inferred from the circumstances, that a certain Calafria,
queen of the island of California, is made a formidable enemy of
Christendom through a large part of the story; and that Constantinople
is said at one time to have been besieged by three millions of heathen.
Nor is the style better than the story. The eloquence which is found
in many passages of the Amadis is not found at all in Esplandian. On
the contrary, large portions of it are written in a low and meagre
style, and the rhymed arguments prefixed to many of the chapters are
any thing but poetry, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p.
233]</span> quite inferior to the few passages of verse scattered
through the Amadis.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379"
class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>The oldest edition of the Esplandian now known to exist was printed
in 1526, and five others appeared before the end of the century; so
that it seems to have enjoyed its full share of popular favor. At any
rate, the example it set was quickly followed. Its principal personages
were made to figure again in a series of connected romances, each
having a hero descended from Amadis, who passes through adventures more
incredible than any of his predecessors, and then gives place, we know
not why, to a son still more extravagant, and, if the phrase may be
used, still more impossible, than his father. Thus, in the same year
1526, we have the sixth book of Amadis de Gaula, called “The History of
Florisando,” his nephew, which is followed by the still more wonderful
“Lisuarte of Greece, Son of Esplandian,” and the most wonderful “Amadis
of Greece,” making respectively the seventh and eighth books. To these
succeeded “Don Florisel de Niquea,” and “Anaxartes, Son of Lisuarte,”
whose history, with that of the children of the last, fills three
books; and finally we have the twelfth book, or “The Great Deeds in
Arms of that Bold Knight, Don Silves de la Selva,” which was printed in
1549; thus giving proof how extraordinary was the success of the whole
series, since its date allows hardly half a century for the production
in Spanish of all these vast romances, most of which, during the same
period, appeared in several, and some of them in many editions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span>Nor did the
effects of the passion thus awakened stop here. Other romances
appeared, belonging to the same family, though not coming into the
regular line of succession, such as a duplicate of the seventh book on
Lisuarte, by the Canon Diaz, in 1526, and “Leandro the Fair,” in 1563,
by Pedro de Luxan, which has sometimes been called the thirteenth;
while in France, where they were all translated successively, as they
appeared in Spain, and became instantly famous, the proper series of
the Amadis romances was stretched out into twenty-four books; after all
which, a certain Sieur Duverdier, grieved that many of them came to
no regular catastrophe, collected the scattered and broken threads of
their multitudinous stories and brought them all to an orderly sequence
of conclusions, in seven large volumes, under the comprehensive and
appropriate name of the “Roman des Romans.” And so ends the history of
the Portuguese type of Amadis of Gaul, as it was originally presented
to the world in the Spanish romances of chivalry; a fiction which,
considering the passionate admiration it so long excited, and the
influence it has, with little merit of its own, exercised on the poetry
and romance of modern Europe ever since, is a phenomenon that has no
parallel in literary history.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>The state
of manners and opinion in Spain, however, which produced this
extraordinary series of romances, could hardly fail to be fertile in
other fictitious heroes, less brilliant, perhaps, in their fame than
was Amadis, but with the same general qualities and attributes. And
such, indeed, was the case. Many romances of chivalry appeared in
Spain, soon after the success of this their great leader; and others
followed a little later. The first of all of them in consequence, if
not in date, is “Palmerin de Oliva”; a personage the more important,
because he had a train of descendants that place him, beyond all doubt,
next in dignity to Amadis.</p>

<p>The Palmerin has often, perhaps generally, been regarded as
Portuguese in its origin, and as the work of a lady; though the proof
of each of these allegations is somewhat imperfect. If, however,
the facts be really as they have been stated, not the least curious
circumstance in relation to them is, that, as in the case of the
Amadis, the Portuguese original of the Palmerin is lost, and the first
and only knowledge we have of its story is from the Spanish version.
Even in this version, we can trace it up no higher than to the edition
printed at Seville in 1525, which was certainly not the first.</p>

<p>But whenever it may have been first published, it was successful.
Several editions were soon printed in Spanish, and translations
followed in Italian and French. A continuation, too, appeared,
called, in form, “The Second Book of Palmerin,” which treats of
the achievements of his sons, Primaleon and Polendos, and of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span> which we have an edition
in Spanish, dated in 1524. The external appearances of the Palmerin,
therefore, announce at once an imitation of the Amadis. The internal
are no less decisive. Its hero, we are told, was grandson to a Greek
emperor in Constantinople, but, being illegitimate, was exposed by
his mother, immediately after his birth, on a mountain, where he
was found, in an osier cradle among olive and palm trees, by a rich
cultivator of bees, who carried him home and named him Palmerin de
Oliva, from the place where he was discovered. He soon gives token of
his high birth; and, making himself famous by numberless exploits, in
Germany, England, and the East, against heathen and enchanters, he at
last reaches Constantinople, where he is recognized by his mother,
marries the daughter of the Emperor of Germany, who is the heroine
of the story, and inherits the crown of Byzantium. The adventures of
Primaleon and Polendos, which seem to be by the same unknown author,
are in the same vein, and were succeeded by those of Platir, grandson
of Palmerin, which were printed as early as 1533. All, taken together,
therefore, leave no doubt that the Amadis was their model, however
much they may have fallen short of its merits.<a id="FNanchor_381"
href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The next in the series, “Palmerin of England,” son of Don Duarde,
or Edward, King of England, and Flerida, a daughter of Palmerin de
Oliva, is a more formidable rival to the Amadis than either of its
predecessors. For a long time it was supposed to have been first
writ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>ten in
Portuguese, and was generally attributed to Francisco Moraes, who
certainly published it in that language at Evora, in 1567, and whose
allegation that he had translated it from the French, though now known
to be true, was supposed to be only a modest concealment of his own
merits. But a copy of the Spanish original, printed at Toledo, in two
parts, in 1547 and 1548, has been discovered, and at the end of its
dedication are a few verses addressed by the author to the reader,
announcing it, in an acrostic, to be the work of Luis Hurtado, known
to have been, at that time, a poet in Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_382"
href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Regarded as a work of art, Palmerin of England is second only
to the Amadis of Gaul, among the romances of chivalry. Like that
great prototype of the whole class, it has among its actors two
brothers,—Palmerin, the faithful knight, and Florian, the free
gallant,—and, like that, it has its great magician, Deliante, and its
perilous isle, where occur not a few of the most agreeable adventures
of its heroes. In some respects, it may be favorably distinguished from
its model. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span>
more sensibility to the beauties of natural scenery in it, and often an
easier dialogue, with quite as good a drawing of individual characters.
But it has greater faults; for its movement is less natural and
spirited, and it is crowded with an unreasonable number of knights, and
an interminable series of duels, battles, and exploits, all of which
claim to be founded on authentic English chronicles and to be true
history, thus affording new proof of the connection between the old
chronicles and the oldest romances. Cervantes admired it excessively.
“Let this Palm of England,” says his curate, “be cared for and
preserved, as a thing singular in its kind, and let a casket be made
for it, like that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius, and
destined to keep in it the works of the poet Homer”; praise, no doubt,
much stronger than can now seem reasonable, but marking, at least, the
sort of estimation in which the romance itself must have been generally
held, when the Don Quixote appeared.</p>

<p>But the family of Palmerin had no further success in Spain. A
third and fourth part, indeed, containing “The Adventures of Duardos
the Second,” appeared in Portuguese, written by Diogo Fernandez, in
1587; and a fifth and sixth are said to have been written by Alvarez
do Oriente, a contemporary poet of no mean reputation. But the last
two do not seem to have been printed, and none of them were much
known beyond the limits of their native country.<a id="FNanchor_383"
href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The Palmerins,
therefore, notwithstanding the merits of one of them, failed to obtain
a fame or a succession that could enter into competition with those of
Amadis and his descendants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="nb mt2">The “Bibliotheca Hispana” has already been referred
to more than once in this chapter, and must so often be relied on as
an authority hereafter that some noticeof its claims should be given
before we proceed farther. Its author, Nicolas Antonio, was born at
Seville, in 1617. He was educated, first by the care of Francisco
Jimenez, a blind teacher, of singular merit, attached to the College of
St. Thomas in that city; and afterwards at Salamanca, where he devoted
himself with success to the study of history and canon law. When he had
completed an honorable career at the University, he returned home, and
lived chiefly in the Convent of the Benedictines, where he had been
bred, and where an abundant and curious library furnished him with
means for study, which he used with eagerness and assiduity.</p>

<p class="nb">He was not, however, in haste to be known. He published
nothing till 1659, when, at the age of forty-two, he printed a Latin
treatise on the Punishment of Exile, and, the same year, was appointed
to the honorable and important post of General Agent of Philip IV. at
Rome. But from this time to the end of his life he was in the public
service, and filled places of no little responsibility. In Rome he
lived twenty years, collecting about him a library said to have been
second in importance only to that of the Vatican, and devoting all his
leisure to the studies he loved. At the end of that period, he returned
to Madrid, and continued there in honorable employments till his death,
which occurred in 1684. He left behind him several works in manuscript,
of which his “Censura de Historias Fabulosas”—an examination and
exposure of several forged chronicles which had appeared in the
preceding century—was first published by Mayans y Siscar, and must be
noticed hereafter.</p>

<p class="nb">But his great labor—the labor of his life and of his
fondest preference—was his literary history of his own country.
He began it in his youth, while he was still living with the
Benedictines,—an order in the Romish Church honorably distinguished
by its zeal in the history of letters,—and he continued it, employing
on his task all the resources which his own large library and the
libraries of the capitals of Spain and of the Christian world could
furnish him, down to the moment of his death. He divided it into two
parts. The first, beginning with the age of Augustus, and coming down
to the year 1500, was found, after his death, digested into the form
of a regular history; but as his pecuniary means, during his lifetime,
had been entirely devoted to the purchase of books, it was published by
his friend Cardinal Aguirre, at Rome, in 1696. The second part, which
had been already printed there, in 1672, is thrown into the form of a
dictionary, whose separate articles are arranged, like those in most
other Spanish works of the same sort, under the baptismal names of
their subjects,—an honor shown to the saints, which renders the use of
such dictionaries somewhat inconvenient, even when, as in the case of
Antonio’s, full indexes are added, which facilitate a reference to the
respective articles by the more common arrangement, according to the
surnames.</p>

<p class="nb">Of both parts an excellent edition was published in
the original Latin, at Madrid, in 1787 and 1788, in four volumes,
folio, commonly known as the “Bibliotheca Vetus et Nova of Nicolas
Antonio”; the first being enriched with notes by Perez Bayer, a learned
Valencian, long the head of the Royal Library at Madrid; and the last
receiving additions from Antonio’s own manuscripts that bring down his
notices of Spanish writers to the time of his death in 1684. In the
earlier portion, embracing the names of about thirteen hundred authors,
little remains to be desired, so far as the Roman or the ecclesiastical
literary history of Spain is concerned; but for the Arabic we must go
to Casiri and Gayangos, and for the Jewish to Castro and Amador de los
Rios; while, for the proper Spanish literature that existed before the
reign of Charles V., manuscripts discovered since the careful labors
of Bayer furnish important additions. In the latter portion, which
contains notices of nearly eight thousand writers of the best period of
Spanish literature, we have—notwithstanding the occasional inaccuracies
and oversights inevitable in a work so vast and so various—a monument
of industry, fairness, and fidelity, for which those who most use it
will always be most grateful. The two, taken together, constitute their
author, beyond all reasonable question, the father and founder of the
literary history of his country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Palmerins failed as
rivals of the great family of Amadis, they were not without their
influence and consideration. Like the other works of their class,
and more than most of them, they helped to increase the passion for
fictions of chivalry in general, which, overbearing every other in the
Peninsula, was now busily at work producing romances, both original
and translated, that astonish us alike by their number, their length,
and their absurdities. Of those originally Spanish, it would not be
difficult, after setting aside the two series belonging to the families
of Amadis and Palmerin, to collect the names of about forty; all
produced in the course of the sixteenth century. Some of them are still
more or less familiar to us, by their names at least, such as “Belianis
of Greece” and “Olivante de Laura,” which are found in Don Quixote’s
library, and “Felixmarte of Hircania,” which was once, we are told, the
summer reading of Dr. Johnson.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a> But, in general, like “The Renowned<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span> Knight Cifar” and “The
Bold Knight Claribalte,” their very titles sound strangely to our ears,
and excite no interest when we hear them repeated. Most of them, it
may be added,—perhaps all,—deserve the oblivion into which they have
fallen; though some have merits which, in the days of their popularity,
placed them near the best of those already noticed.</p>

<p>Among the latter is “The Invincible Knight Lepolemo, called the
Knight of the Cross and Son of the Emperor of Germany”; a romance,
which was published as early as 1525, and, besides drawing a
continuation after it, was reprinted thrice in the course of the
century, and translated into French and Italian.<a id="FNanchor_385"
href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> It is a striking book
among those of its class, not only from the variety of fortunes through
which the hero passes, but, in some degree, from its general tone and
purpose. In his infancy Lepolemo is stolen from the shelter of the
throne to which he is heir, and completely lost for a long period.
During this time he lives among the heathen; at first in slavery,
and afterwards as an honorable knight-adventurer at the court of the
Soldan. By his courage and merit he rises to great distinction, and,
while on a journey through France, is recognized by his own family, who
happen to be there. Of course he is restored, amidst a general jubilee,
to his imperial estate.</p>

<p>In all this, and especially in the wearisome series of its knightly
adventures, the Lepolemo has a sufficient resemblance to the other
romances of chivalry. But in two points it differs from them. In the
first place, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span>
pretends to be translated by Pedro de Luxan, its real author, from the
Arabic of a wise magician attached to the person of the Sultan; and
yet it represents its hero throughout as a most Christian knight, and
his father and mother, the Emperor and Empress, as giving the force of
their example to encourage pilgrimages to the Holy Sepulchre; making
the whole story subserve the projects of the Church, in the same way,
if not to the same degree, that Turpin’s Chronicle had done. And in
the next place, it attracts our attention, from time to time, by a
picturesque air and touches of the national manners, as, for instance,
in the love passages between the Knight of the Cross and the Infanta
of France, in one of which he talks to her at her grated balcony in
the night, as if he were a cavalier of one of Calderon’s comedies.<a
id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
Except in these points, however, the Lepolemo is much like its
predecessors and followers, and quite as tedious.</p>

<p>Spain, however, not only gave romances of chivalry to the rest of
Europe in large numbers, but received also from abroad in some good
proportion to what she gave. From the first, the early French fictions
were known in Spain, as we have seen by the allusions to them in the
“Amadis de Gaula”; a circumstance that may have been owing either to
the old connection with France through the Burgundian family, a branch
of which filled the throne of Portugal, or to some strange accident,
like the one that carried “Palmerin de Inglaterra” to Portugal from
France rather than from Spain, its native country. At any rate,
somewhat later, when the passion for such fictions was more developed,
the French stories were translated or imitated in Spanish,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span> and became a part, and
a favored part, of the literature of the country. “The Romance of
Merlin” was printed very early,—as early as 1498,—and “The Romance of
Tristan de Leonnais,” and that of the Holy Cup, “La Demanda del Sancto
Grial,” followed it as a sort of natural sequence.<a id="FNanchor_387"
href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>The rival story of Charlemagne, however,—perhaps from the greatness
of his name,—seems to have been, at last, more successful. It is a
translation directly from the French, and therefore gives none of
those accounts of his defeat at Roncesvalles by Bernardo del Carpio,
which, in the old Spanish chronicles and ballads, so gratified the
national vanity; and contains only the accustomed stories of Oliver
and Fierabras the Giant; of Orlando and the False Ganelon; relying, of
course, on the fabulous Chronicle of Turpin as its chief authority.
But, such as it was, it found great favor at the time it appeared;
and such, in fact, as Nicolas de Piamonte gave it to the world, in
1528, under the title of “The History of the Emperor Charlemagne,”
it has been constantly reprinted down to our own times, and has
done more than any other tale of chivalry to keep alive in Spain a
taste for such reading.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388"
class="fnanchor">[388]</a> During a considerable period, however, a
few other romances shared its popularity. “Reynaldos de Montalban,”
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span> instance,
always a favorite hero in Spain, was one of them;<a id="FNanchor_389"
href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> and a little later
we find another, the story of “Cleomadez,” an invention of a French
queen in the thirteenth century, which first gave to Froissart the
love for adventure that made him a chronicler.<a id="FNanchor_390"
href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>In most of the imitations and translations just noticed, the
influence of the Church is more visible than it is in the class of the
original Spanish romances. This is the case, from its very subject,
with the story of the Saint Graal, and with that of Charlemagne,
which, so far as it is taken from the pretended Archbishop Turpin’s
Chronicle, goes mainly to encourage founding religious houses and
making pious pilgrimages. But the Church was not satisfied with
this indirect and accidental influence. Romantic fiction, though
overlooked in its earliest beginnings, or perhaps even punished by
ecclesiastical authority in the person of the Greek Bishop to whom we
owe the first proper romance,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391"
class="fnanchor">[391]</a> was now become important, and might be
made directly useful. Religious romances, therefore, were written.
In general, they were cast into the form of allegories, like “The
Celestial Chivalry,” “The Christian Chivalry<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span>,” “The Knight of the Bright Star,”
and “The Christian History and Warfare of the Stranger Knight, the
Conqueror of Heaven”;—all printed after the middle of the sixteenth
century, and during the period when the passion for romances of
chivalry was at its height.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>One of the oldest of them is probably the most curious and
remarkable of the whole number. It is appropriately called “The
Celestial Chivalry,” and was written by Hierónimo de San Pedro,
at Valencia, and printed in 1554, in two thin folio volumes.<a
id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> In
his Preface, the author declares it to be his object to drive out
of the world the profane books of chivalry; the mischief of which
he illustrates by a reference to Dante’s account of Francesca da
Rimini. In pursuance of this purpose, the First Part is entitled “The
Root of the Fragrant Rose”; which, instead of chapters, is divided
into “Wonders,” <i>Maravillas</i>, and contains an allegorical version of
the most striking stories in the Old Testament, down to the time of
the good King Hezekiah, told as the adventures of a succession of
knights-errant. The Second Part is divided, according to a similar
conceit, into “The Leaves of the Rose”; and, beginning where the
preceding one ends, comes down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p.
247]</span> with the same kind of knightly adventures, to the Saviour’s
death and ascension. The Third, which is promised under the name
of “The Flower of the Rose,” never appeared, nor is it now easy to
understand where consistent materials could have been found for its
composition; the Bible having been nearly exhausted in the two former
parts. But we have enough without it.</p>

<p>Its chief allegory, from the nature of its subject, relates to
the Saviour, and fills seventy-four out of the one hundred and one
“Leaves,” or chapters, that constitute the Second Part. Christ is
represented in it as the Knight of the Lion; his twelve Apostles as
the twelve Knights of his Round Table; John the Baptist as the Knight
of the Desert; and Lucifer as the Knight of the Serpent;—the main
history being a warfare between the Knight of the Lion and the Knight
of the Serpent. It begins at the manger of Bethlehem, and ends on
Mount Calvary, involving in its progress almost every detail of the
Gospel history, and often using the very words of Scripture. Every
thing, however, is forced into the forms of a strange and revolting
allegory. Thus, for the temptation, the Saviour wears the shield of
the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and rides on the steed of Penitence,
given to him by Adam. He then takes leave of his mother, the daughter
of the Celestial Emperor, like a youthful knight going out to his first
passage at arms, and proceeds to the waste and desert country, where he
is sure to find adventures. On his approach, the Knight of the Desert
prepares himself to do battle; but, perceiving who it is, humbles
himself before his coming prince and master. The baptism of course
follows; that is, the Knight of the Lion is received into the order of
the Knighthood of Baptism, in the presence of an old man, who turns out
to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> Anagogic
Master, or the Interpreter of all Mysteries, and two women, one young
and the other old. All three of them enter directly into a spirited
discussion concerning the nature of the rite they have just witnessed.
The old man speaks at large, and explains it as a heavenly allegory.
The old woman, who proves to be Sinagoga, or the representation of
Judaism, prefers the ancient ordinance provided by Abraham, and
authorized, as she says, by “that celebrated Doctor, Moses,” rather
than this new rite of baptism. The younger woman replies, and defends
the new institution. She is the Church Militant; and the Knight of the
Desert, deciding the point in her favor, Sinagoga goes off full of
anger, ending thus the first part of the action.</p>

<p>The great Anagogic Master, according to an understanding previously
had with the Church Militant, now follows the Knight of the Lion to
the desert, and there explains to him the true mystery and efficacy of
Christian baptism. After this preparation, the Knight enters on his
first adventure and battle with the Knight of the Serpent, which, in
all its details, is represented as a duel,—one of the parties coming
into the lists accompanied by Abel, Moses, and David, and the other
by Cain, Goliath, and Haman. Each of the speeches recorded in the
Evangelists is here made an arrow-shot or a sword-thrust; the scene on
the pinnacle of the temple, and the promises made there, are brought in
as far as their incongruous nature will permit; and then the whole of
this part of the long romance is abruptly ended by the precipitate and
disgraceful flight of the Knight of the Serpent.</p>

<p>This scene of the temptation, strange as it now seems to us, is,
nevertheless, not an unfavorable specimen of the entire fiction. The
allegory is almost everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p.
249]</span> quite as awkward and unmanageable as it is here, and often
leads to equally painful and disgusting absurdities. On the other hand,
we have occasionally proofs of an imagination that is not ungraceful;
just as the formal and extravagant style in which it is written now and
then gives token that its author was not insensible to the resources
of a language he, in general, so much abuses.<a id="FNanchor_394"
href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>There is, no doubt, a wide space between such a fiction as this
of the Celestial Chivalry and the comparatively simple and direct
story of the Amadis de Gaula; and when we recollect that only half
a century elapsed between the dates of these romances in Spain,<a
id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> we
shall be struck with the fact that this space was very quickly passed
over, and that all the varieties of the romances of chivalry are
crowded into a comparatively short period of time. But we must not
forget that the success of these fictions, thus suddenly obtained, is
spread afterwards over a much longer period. The earliest of them were
familiarly known in Spain during the fifteenth century, the sixteenth
is thronged with them, and, far into the seventeenth, they were still
much read; so that their influence over the Spanish character extends
through quite two hundred years. Their number, too, during the latter
part of the time when they prevailed, was large. It exceeded seventy,
nearly all of them in folio; each often in more than one volume, and
still oftener repeated in successive editions;—circumstances which,
at a period when books were comparatively rare and not frequently
reprinted, show that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p.
250]</span> their popularity must have been widely spread, as well as
long continued.</p>

<p>This might, perhaps, have been, in some degree, expected in a
country where the institutions and feelings of chivalry had struck
such firm root as they had in Spain. For Spain, when the romances
of chivalry first appeared, had long been peculiarly the land of
knighthood. The Moorish wars, which had made every gentleman a soldier,
necessarily tended to this result; and so did the free spirit of the
communities, led on as they were, during the next period, by barons,
who long continued almost as independent in their castles as the king
was on his throne. Such a state of things, in fact, is to be recognized
as far back as the thirteenth century, when the Partidas, by the
most minute and painstaking legislation, provided for a condition of
society not easily to be distinguished from that set forth in the
Amadis or the Palmerin.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396"
class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The poem and history of the Cid bear witness
yet earlier, indirectly indeed, but very strongly, to a similar state
of the country; and so do many of the old ballads and other records of
the national feelings and traditions that had come from the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>But in the fifteenth, the chronicles are full of it, and exhibit
it in forms the most grave and imposing. Dangerous tournaments,
in some of which the chief men of the time, and even the kings
themselves, took part, occur constantly, and are recorded among the
important events of the age.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397"
class="fnanchor">[397]</a> At the passage of arms<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span> near Orbigo, in the reign of John the
Second, eighty knights, as we have seen, were found ready to risk
their lives for as fantastic a fiction of gallantry as is recorded
in any of the romances of chivalry; a folly, of which this was by no
means the only instance.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398"
class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Nor did they confine their extravagances
to their own country. In the same reign, two Spanish knights went
as far as Burgundy, professedly in search of adventures, which they
strangely mingled with a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; seeming to regard
both as religious exercises.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399"
class="fnanchor">[399]</a> And as late as the time of Ferdinand and
Isabella, Fernando del Pulgar, their wise secretary, gives us the names
of several distinguished noblemen personally known to himself, who
had gone into foreign countries, “in order,” as he says, “to try the
fortune of arms with any cavalier that might be pleased to adventure it
with them, and so gain honor for themselves, and the fame of valiant
and bold knights for the gentlemen of Castile.”<a id="FNanchor_400"
href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>A state of society like this was the natural result of the
extraordinary development which the institutions of chivalry had
then received in Spain. Some of it was suited to the age, and
salutary; the rest was knight-errantry, and knight-errantry in
its wildest extravagance. When, however, the imaginations of men
were so excited as to tolerate and maintain, in their daily life,
such manners and institutions as these, they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> would not fail to enjoy the boldest
and most free representations of a corresponding state of society in
works of romantic fiction. But they went farther. Extravagant and
even impossible as are many of the adventures recorded in the books
of chivalry, they still seemed so little to exceed the absurdities
frequently witnessed or told of known and living men, that many persons
took the romances themselves to be true histories, and believed
them. Thus, Mexia, the trustworthy historiographer of Charles the
Fifth, says, in 1545, when speaking of “the Amadises, Lisuartes, and
Clarions,” that “their authors do waste their time and weary their
faculties in writing such books, which are read by all and believed
by many. For,” he goes on, “there be men who think all these things
really happened, just as they read or hear them, though the greater
part of the things themselves are sinful, profane, and unbecoming.”<a
id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> And
Castillo, another chronicler, tells us gravely, in 1587, that Philip
the Second, when he married Mary of England, only forty years earlier,
promised, that, if King Arthur should return to claim the throne, he
would peaceably yield to that prince all his rights; thus implying, at
least in Castillo himself, and probably in many of his readers, a full
faith in the stories of Arthur and his Round Table.<a id="FNanchor_402"
href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Such credulity, it is true, now seems impossible, even if we
suppose it was confined to a moderate number of intelligent persons;
and hardly less so, when, as in the admirable sketch of an easy faith
in the stories of chivalry by the innkeeper and Maritornes in Don
Quixote, we are shown that it extended to the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span> mass of the people.<a id="FNanchor_403"
href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> But before we refuse
our assent to the statements of such faithful chroniclers as Mexia, on
the ground that what they relate is impossible, we should recollect,
that, in the age when they lived, men were in the habit of believing
and asserting every day things no less incredible than those recited
in the old romances. The Spanish Church then countenanced a trust
in miracles, as of constant recurrence, which required of those who
believed them more credulity than the fictions of chivalry; and yet how
few were found wanting in faith! And how few doubted the tales that
had come down to them of the impossible achievements of their fathers
during the seven centuries of their warfare against the Moors, or the
glorious traditions of all sorts, that still constitute the charm of
their brave old chronicles, though we now see at a glance that many of
them are as fabulous as any thing told of Palmerin or Launcelot!</p>

<p>But whatever we may think of this belief in the romances of
chivalry, there is no question that in Spain, during the sixteenth
century, there prevailed a passion for them such as was never known
elsewhere. The proof of it comes to us from all sides. The poetry of
the country is full of it, from the romantic ballads that still live
in the memory of the people, up to the old plays that have ceased to
be acted and the old epics that have ceased to be read. The national
manners and the national dress, more peculiar and picturesque than
in other countries, long bore its sure impress. The old laws, too,
speak no less plainly. Indeed, the passion for such fictions was so
strong, and seemed so dangerous, that in 1553 they were prohibited
from being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span>
printed, sold, or read in the American colonies; and in 1555 the
Cortes earnestly asked that the same prohibition might be extended to
Spain itself, and that all the extant copies of romances of chivalry
might be publicly burned.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404"
class="fnanchor">[404]</a> And finally, half a century later, the
happiest work of the greatest genius Spain has produced bears witness
on every page to the prevalence of an absolute fanaticism for books of
chivalry, and becomes at once the seal of their vast popularity and the
monument of their fate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Drama.</span>—The ancient theatre of the
Greeks and Romans was continued under some of its grosser and more
popular forms at Constantinople, in Italy, and in many other parts of
the falling and fallen empire, far into the Middle Ages. But, under
whatever disguise it appeared, it was essentially heathenish; for, from
first to last, it was mythological, both in tone and in substance. As
such, of course, it was rebuked and opposed by the Christian Church,
which, favored by the confusion and ignorance of the times, succeeded
in overthrowing it, though not without a long contest, and not until
its degradation and impurity had rendered it worthy of its fate and of
the anathemas pronounced against it by Tertullian and Saint Augustin.<a
id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>A love for theatrical exhibitions, however, survived the extinction
of these poor remains of the classical drama; and the priesthood,
careful neither to make itself needlessly odious, nor to neglect any
suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span> method
of increasing its own influence, seems early to have been willing to
provide a substitute for the popular amusement it had destroyed. At
any rate, a substitute soon appeared; and, coming as it did out of
the ceremonies and commemorations of the religion of the times, its
appearance was natural and easy. The greater festivals of the Church
had for centuries been celebrated with whatever of pomp the rude luxury
of ages so troubled could afford, and they now everywhere, from London
to Rome, added a dramatic element to their former attractions. Thus,
the manger at Bethlehem, with the worship of the shepherds and Magi,
was, at a very early period, solemnly exhibited every year by a visible
show before the altars of the churches at Christmas, as were the
tragical events of the last days of the Saviour’s life during Lent and
at the approach of Easter.</p>

<p>Gross abuses, dishonoring alike the priesthood and religion, were,
no doubt, afterwards mingled with these representations, both while
they were given in dumb show, and when, by the addition of dialogue,
they became what were called Mysteries; but, in many parts of Europe,
the representations themselves, down to a comparatively late period,
were found so well suited to the spirit of the times, that different
Popes granted especial indulgences to the persons who frequented
them, and they were in fact used openly and successfully, not only as
means of amusement, but for the religious edification of an ignorant
multitude. In England such shows prevailed for above four hundred
years,—a longer period than can be assigned to the English national
drama, as we now recognize it; while in Italy and other countries
still under the influence of the See of Rome, they have, in some of
their forms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span>
been continued, for the edification and amusement of the populace,
quite down to our own times.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406"
class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>That all traces of the ancient Roman theatre, except the
architectural remains which still bear witness to its splendor,<a
id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
disappeared from Spain in consequence of the occupation of the
country by the Arabs, whose national spirit rejected the drama
altogether, cannot be reasonably doubted. But the time when the more
modern representations were begun on religious subjects, and under
ecclesiastical patronage, can no longer be determined. It must,
however, have been very early; for, in the middle of the thirteenth
century, such performances were not only known, but had been so
long practised, that they had already taken various forms, and
become disgraced by various abuses. This is apparent from the code
of Alfonso the Tenth, which was prepared about 1260; and in which,
after forbidding the clergy certain gross indulgences, the law goes
on to say: “Neither ought they to be makers of buffoon plays,<a
id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> that
people may come to see them; and if other men make them, clergymen
should not come to see them, for such men do many things low and
unsuitable. Nor, moreover, should such things be done in the churches;
but rather we say that they should be cast<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span> out in dishonor, without punishment to
those engaged in them. For the church of God was made for prayer, and
not for buffoonery; as our Lord Jesus Christ declared in the Gospel,
that his house was called the House of Prayer, and ought not to be made
a den of thieves. But exhibitions there be, that clergymen may make,
such as that of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, which shows how the
angel came to the shepherds and how he told them Jesus Christ was born,
and, moreover, of his appearance when the Three Kings came to worship
him, and of his resurrection, which shows how he was crucified and rose
the third day. Such things as these, which move men to do well, may the
clergy make, as well as to the end that men may have in remembrance
that such things did truly happen. But this must they do decently, and
in devotion, and in the great cities where there is an archbishop or
bishop, and under their authority, or that of others by them deputed,
and not in villages, nor in small places, nor to gain money thereby.”<a
id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>But though these earliest religious representations in Spain,
whether pantomimic or in dialogue, were thus given, not only by
churchmen, but by others, certainly before the middle of the thirteenth
century, and probably much sooner, and though they were continued for
several centuries afterwards, still no fragment of them and no distinct
account of them now remain to us. Nor is any thing properly dramatic
found even amongst the secular poetry of Spain, till the latter part
of the fifteenth century, though it may have existed somewhat earlier,
as we may infer from a passage in the Marquis of Santillana’s letter
to the Constable of Portugal;<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410"
class="fnanchor">[410]</a> from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p.
259]</span> the notice of a moral play by the Marquis of Villena,
now lost, which is said to have been represented in 1414, before
Ferdinand of Aragon;<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411"
class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and from the hint left by the picturesque
chronicler of the Constable de Luna concerning the <i>Entremeses</i><a
id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
or Interludes, which were sometimes arranged by that proud favorite
a little later in the same century. These indications, however, are
very slight and uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413"
class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span>A nearer
approach to the spirit of the drama, and particularly to the form which
the secular drama first took in Spain, is to be found in the curious
dialogue called “The Couplets of Mingo Revulgo”; a satire thrown into
the shape of an eclogue, and given in the free and spirited language
of the lower classes of the people, on the deplorable state of public
affairs, as they existed in the latter part of the weak reign of Henry
the Fourth. It seems to have been written about the year 1472.<a
id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The
interlocutors are two shepherds; one of whom, called Mingo Revulgo,—a
name corrupted from Domingo Vulgus,—represents the common people; and
the other, called Gil Arribato, or Gil the Elevated, represents the
higher classes, and speaks with the authority of a prophet, who, while
complaining of the ruinous condition of the state, yet lays no small
portion of the blame on the common people, for having, as he says, by
their weakness and guilt, brought upon themselves so dissolute and
careless a shepherd. It opens with the shouts of Arribato, who sees
Revulgo at a distance, on a Sunday morning, ill dressed and with a
dispirited air:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Hollo, Revulgo! Mingo, ho!</p>
<p class="i0">Mingo Revulgo! Ho, hollo!</p>
<p class="i0">Why, where’s your cloak of blue so bright?</p>
<p class="i0">Is it not Sunday’s proper wear?</p>
<p class="i0">And where ’s your jacket red and tight?</p>
<p class="i0">And such a brow why do you bear,</p>
<p class="i0">And come abroad, this dawning mild,</p>
<p class="i0">With all your hair in elf-locks wild?</p>
<p class="i0">Pray, are you broken down with care?<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p.
261]</span>Revulgo replies, that the state of the flock, governed by
so unfit a shepherd, is the cause of his squalid condition; and then,
under this allegory, they urge a coarse, but efficient, satire against
the measures of the government, against the base, cowardly character of
the king and his scandalous, passion for his Portuguese mistress, and
against the ruinous carelessness and indifference of the people, ending
with praises of the contentment found in a middle condition of life.
The whole dialogue consists of only thirty-two stanzas of nine lines
each; but it produced a great effect at the time, was often printed in
the next century, and was twice elucidated by a grave commentary.<a
id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Its author wisely concealed his name, and has never been
absolutely ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417"
class="fnanchor">[417]</a> The earlier editions generally suppose
him to have been Rodrigo Cota, the elder, of Toledo, to whom also is
attributed “A Dialogue between Love and an Old Man,” which dates from
the same period, and is no less spirited and even more dramatic. It
opens with a representation of an old man retired into a poor hut,
which stands in the midst of a neglected and decayed garden. Suddenly
Love appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span> before
him, and he exclaims, “My door is shut; what do you want? Where did you
enter? Tell me how, robber-like, you leaped the walls of my garden. Age
and reason had freed me from you; leave, therefore, my heart, retired
into its poor corner, to think only of the past.” He goes on giving a
sad account of his own condition, and a still more sad description of
Love; to which Love replies, with great coolness, “Your discourse shows
that you have not been well acquainted with me.” A discussion follows,
in which Love, of course, gains the advantage. The old man is promised
that his garden shall be restored and his youth renewed; but when he
has surrendered at discretion, he is only treated with the gayest
ridicule by his conqueror, for thinking that at his age he can again
make himself attractive in the ways of love. The whole is in a light
tone and managed with a good deal of ingenuity; but though susceptible,
like other poetical eclogues, of being represented, it is not certain
that it ever was. It is, however, as well as the Couplets of Revulgo,
so much like the pastorals which we know were publicly exhibited
as dramas a few years later, that we may reasonably suppose it had
some influence in preparing the way for them.<a id="FNanchor_418"
href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>The next contribution to the foundations of the Spanish theatre
is the “Celestina,” a dramatic story, con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span>temporary with the poems just noticed,
and probably, in part, the work of the same hands. It is a prose
composition, in twenty-one acts, or parts, originally called, “The
Tragicomedy of Calisto and Melibœa”; and though, from its length,
and, indeed, from its very structure, it can never have been
represented, its dramatic spirit and movement have left traces, that
are not to to be mistaken,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419"
class="fnanchor">[419]</a> of their influence on the national drama
ever since.</p>

<p>The first act, which is much the longest, was probably written by
Rodrigo Cota, of Toledo, and in that case we may safely assume that
it was produced about 1480.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420"
class="fnanchor">[420]</a> It opens in the environs of a city,
which is not named,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421"
class="fnanchor">[421]</a> with a scene between Calisto, a young<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span> man of rank, and Melibœa,
a maiden of birth and qualities still more noble than his own. He finds
her in her father’s garden, where he had accidentally followed his bird
in hawking, and she receives him as a Spanish lady of condition in that
age would be likely to receive a stranger who begins his acquaintance
by making love to her. The result is, that the presumptuous young man
goes home full of mortification and despair, and shuts himself up in
his darkened chamber. Sempronio, a confidential servant, understanding
the cause of his master’s trouble, advises him to apply to an old
woman, with whom the unprincipled valet is secretly in league, and who
is half a pretender to witchcraft and half a dealer in love philters.
This personage is Celestina. Her character, the first hint of which
may have been taken from the Archpriest of Hita’s sketch of one with
not dissimilar pretensions, is at once revealed in all its power. She
boldly promises Calisto that he shall obtain possession of Melibœa, and
from that moment secures to herself a complete control over him, and
over all who are about him.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422"
class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Thus far Cota had proceeded in his outline, when, from some
unknown reason, he stopped short. The fragment he had written was,
however, circulated and admired, and Fernando de Rojas of Montalvan,
a bachelor of laws living at Salamanca, took it up, at the request of
some of his friends, and, as he himself tells us, wrote the remainder
in a fortnight of his vacations; the twenty acts or scenes which he
added for this purpose constituting about seven eighths of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span> the whole composition.<a
id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> That
the conclusion he thus arranged was such as the original inventor of
the story intended is not to be imagined. Rojas was even uncertain
who this first author was, and evidently knew nothing about his plans
or purposes; besides which, he says, the portion that came into his
hands was a comedy, while the remainder is so violent and bloody in its
course, that he calls his completed work a tragicomedy; a name which it
has generally borne since, and which he perhaps invented to suit this
particular case. One circumstance, however, connected with it should
not be overlooked. It is, that the different portions attributed to
the two authors are so similar in style and finish, as to have led to
the conjecture, that, after all, the whole might have been the work of
Rojas, who, for reasons, perhaps, arising out of his ecclesiastical
position in society, was unwilling to take the responsibility of
being the sole author of it.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424"
class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>But this is not the account given by Rojas himself. He says that
he found the first act already written; and he begins the second with
the impatience of Calisto, in urging Celestina to obtain access to the
high-born and high-bred Melibœa. The low and vulgar woman succeeds,
by presenting herself at the house of Mel<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span>ibœa’s father with lady-like trifles to
sell, and, having once obtained an entrance, easily finds the means
of establishing her right to return. Intrigues of the grossest kind
amongst the servants and subordinates follow; and the machinations and
contrivances of the mover of the whole mischief advance through the
midst of them with great rapidity,—all managed by herself, and all
contributing to her power and purposes. Nothing, indeed, seems to be
beyond the reach of her unprincipled activity and talent. She talks
like a saint or a philosopher, as it suits her purpose. She flatters;
she threatens; she overawes; her unscrupulous ingenuity is never at
fault; her main object is never forgotten or overlooked.</p>

<p>Meantime, the unhappy Melibœa, urged by whatever insinuation and
seduction can suggest, is made to confess her love for Calisto. From
this moment, her fate is sealed. Calisto visits her secretly in the
night, after the fashion of the old Spanish gallants; and then the
conspiracy hurries onward to its consummation. At the same time,
however, the retribution begins. The persons who had assisted Calisto
to bring about his first interview with her quarrel for the reward
he had given them; and Celestina, at the moment of her triumph,
is murdered by her own base agents and associates, two of whom,
attempting to escape, are in their turn summarily put to death by
the officers of justice. Great confusion ensues. Calisto is regarded
as the indirect cause of Celestina’s death, since she perished in
his service; and some of those who had been dependent upon her are
roused to such indignation, that they track him to the place of his
assignation, seeking for revenge. There they fall into a quarrel with
the servants he had posted in the streets for his protection. He
hastens to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span>
rescue, is precipitated from a ladder, and is killed on the spot.
Melibœa confesses her guilt and shame, and throws herself headlong from
a high tower; immediately upon which the whole melancholy and atrocious
story ends with the lament of the broken-hearted father over her dead
body.</p>

<p>As has been intimated, the Celestina is rather a dramatized romance
than a proper drama, or even a well-considered attempt to produce a
strictly dramatic effect. Such as it is, however, Europe can show
nothing on its theatres, at the same period, of equal literary merit.
It is full of life and movement throughout. Its characters, from
Celestina down to her insolent and lying valets, and her brutal female
associates, are developed with a skill and truth rarely found in
the best periods of the Spanish drama. Its style is easy and pure,
sometimes brilliant, and always full of the idiomatic resources of the
old and true Castilian; such a style, unquestionably, as had not yet
been approached in Spanish prose, and was not often reached afterwards.
Occasionally, indeed, we are offended by an idle and cold display of
learning; but, like the gross manners of the piece, this poor vanity is
a fault that belonged to the age.</p>

<p>The great offence of the Celestina, however, is, that large portions
of it are foul with a shameless libertinism of thought and language.
Why the authority of church and state did not at once interfere to
prevent its circulation seems now hardly intelligible. Probably it
was, in part, because the Celestina claimed to be written for the
purpose of warning the young against the seductions and crimes it
so loosely unveils; or, in other words, because it claimed to be a
book whose tendency was good. Certainly, strange as the fact may now
seem to us, many so received it. It was dedicated to rever<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span>end ecclesiastics, and
to ladies of rank and modesty in Spain and out of it, and seems
to have been read generally, and perhaps by the wise, the gentle,
and the good, without a blush. When, therefore, those who had the
power were called to exercise it, they shrank from the task; only
slight changes were required; and the Celestina was then left to
run its course of popular favor unchecked.<a id="FNanchor_425"
href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> In the century that
followed its first appearance from the press in 1499, a century in
which the number of readers was comparatively very small, it is easy
to enumerate above thirty editions of the original. Probably there
were more. At that time, too, or soon afterwards, it was made known
in English, in German, and in Dutch; and, that none of the learned
at least might be beyond its reach, it appeared in the universal
Latin. Thrice it was translated into Italian, and thrice into French.
The cautious and severe author of the “Dialogue on Languages,” the
Protestant Valdés, gave it the highest praise.<a id="FNanchor_426"
href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> So did Cervantes.<a
id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The
very name of Celestina became a proverb, like the thousand bywords
and adages she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span>
herself pours out, with such wit and fluency;<a id="FNanchor_428"
href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and it is not too much
to add, that, down to the days of the Don Quixote, no Spanish book was
so much known and read at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Such success insured for it a long series of imitations; most of
them yet more offensive to morals and public decency than the Celestina
itself, and all of them, as might be anticipated, of inferior literary
merit to their model. One, called “The Second Comedia of Celestina,” in
which she is raised from the dead, was published in 1530, by Feliciano
de Silva, the author of the old romance of “Florisel de Niquea,”
and went through four editions. Another, by Domingo de Castega, was
sometimes added to the successive reprints of the original work
after 1534. A third, by Gaspar Gomez de Toledo, appeared in 1537; a
fourth, ten years later, by an unknown author, called “The Tragedy of
Policiana,” in twenty-nine acts; a fifth, in 1554, by Joan Rodrigues
Florian, in forty-three scenes, called “The Comedia of Florinea”;
and a sixth, “The Selvagia,” in five acts, also in 1554, by Alonso
de Villegas. In 1513, Pedro de Urrea, of the same family with the
translator of Ariosto, rendered the first act of the original Celestina
into good Castilian verse, dedicating it to his mother; and in 1540,
Juan Sedeño, the translator of Tasso, performed a similar service for
the whole of it. Tales and romances followed, somewhat later, in large
numbers; some, like “The Ingenious Helen,” and “The Cunning Flora,”
not without merit; while others, like “The Eufrosina,” praised more
than it deserves by Quevedo, were little regarded from the first.<a
id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span></p>

<p>At last, it came upon the stage, for which its original character
had so nearly fitted it. Cepeda, in 1582, formed out of it one half
of his “Comedia Selvage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p.
271]</span>,” which is only the four first acts of the Celestina,
thrown into easy verse;<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430"
class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and Alfonso Vaz de Velasco, as early
as 1602, published a drama in prose, called “The Jealous Man,”
founded entirely on the Celestina, whose character, under the name
of Lena, is given with nearly all its original spirit and effect.<a
id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> How
far either the play of Velasco or that of Cepeda succeeded, we are
not told; but the coarseness and indecency of both are so great, that
they can hardly have been long tolerated by the public, if they were
by the Church. The essential type of Celestina, however, the character
as originally conceived by Cota and Rojas, was continued on the stage
in such plays as the “Celestina” of Mendoza, “The Second Celestina” of
Agustin de Salazar, and “The School of Celestina” by Salas Barbadillo,
all produced soon after the year 1600, as well as in others that have
been produced since. Even in our own days, a drama containing so much
of her story as a modern audience will listen to has been received with
favor; while, at the same time, the original tragicomedy itself has
been thought worthy of being reprinted at Madrid, with various readings
to settle its text, and of being rendered anew by fresh and vigorous
translations into the French and the German.<a id="FNanchor_432"
href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p. 272]</span>The influence,
therefore, of the Celestina seems not yet at an end, little as it
deserves regard, except for its lifelike exhibition of the most
unworthy forms of human character, and its singularly pure, rich, and
idiomatic Castilian style.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> “Celestina,” as has been intimated,
produced little or no immediate effect on the rude beginnings of
the Spanish drama; perhaps not so much as the dialogues of “Mingo
Revulgo,” and “Love and the Old Man.” But the three taken together
unquestionably lead us to the true founder of the secular theatre in
Spain, Juan de la Enzina,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433"
class="fnanchor">[433]</a> who was probably born in the village whose
name he bears, in 1468 or 1469, and was educated at the neighbouring
University of Salamanca, where he had the good fortune to enjoy the
patronage of its chancellor, then one of the rising family of Alva.
Soon afterwards he was at court; and at the age of twenty-five, we find
him in the household of Fadrique de Toledo, first Duke of Alva, to whom
and to his duchess Enzina addressed much of his poetry. In 1496, he
published the earliest edition of his works, divided into four parts,
which are successively dedicated to Ferdinand and Isabella, to the
Duke and Duchess of Alva, to Prince John, and to Don Garcia de Toledo,
son of his patron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span>Somewhat later,
Enzina went to Rome, where he became a priest, and, from his skill in
music, rose to be head of Leo the Tenth’s chapel; the highest honor
the world then offered to his art. In the course of the year 1519,
he made a pilgrimage from Rome to Jerusalem with Fadrique Afan de
Ribera, Marquis of Tarifa; and on his return, published, in 1521,
a poor poetical account of his devout adventures, accompanied with
great praises of the Marquis, and ending with an expression of his
happiness at living in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434"
class="fnanchor">[434]</a> At a more advanced age, however, having
received a priory in Leon as a reward for his services, he returned to
his native country, and died, in 1534, at Salamanca, in whose cathedral
his monument is probably still to be seen.<a id="FNanchor_435"
href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>Of his collected works six editions at least were published between
1496 and 1516; showing, that, for the period in which he lived, he
enjoyed a remarkable degree of popularity. They contain a good deal of
pleasant lyrical poetry, songs, and <i>villancicos</i>, in the old popular
Spanish style; and two or three descriptive<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span> poems, particularly “A Vision of the
Temple of Fame and the Glories of Castile,” in which Ferdinand and
Isabella receive great eulogy and are treated as if they were his
patrons. But most of his shorter poems were slight contributions of his
talent offered on particular occasions; and by far the most important
works he has left us are the dramatic compositions which fill the
fourth division of his Cancionero.</p>

<p>These compositions are called by Enzina himself “Representaciones”;
and in the edition of 1496 there are nine of them, while in the
last two editions there are eleven, one of which contains the date
of 1498. They are in the nature of eclogues, though one of them, it
is difficult to tell why, is called an “Auto”;<a id="FNanchor_436"
href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> and they were
represented before the Duke and Duchess of Alva, the Prince Don John,
the Duke of Infantado, and other distinguished personages enumerated in
the notices prefixed to them. All are in some form of the old Spanish
verse; in all there is singing; and in one there is a dance. They have,
therefore, several of the elements of the proper secular Spanish drama,
whose origin we can trace no farther back by any authentic monument now
existing.</p>

<p>Two things, however, should be noted, when considering these
dramatic efforts of Juan de la Enzina as the foundation of the Spanish
drama. The first is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span>
their internal structure and essential character. They are eclogues
only in form and name, not in substance and spirit. Enzina, whose
poetical account of his travels in Palestine proves him to have had
scholarlike knowledge, began by translating, or rather paraphrasing,
the ten Eclogues of Virgil, accommodating some of them to events in
the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, or to passages in the fortunes
of the house of Alva.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437"
class="fnanchor">[437]</a> From these, he easily passed to the
preparation of eclogues to be represented before his patrons and their
courtly friends. But, in doing this, he was naturally reminded of the
religious exhibitions, which had been popular in Spain from the time
of Alfonso the Tenth, and had always been given at the great festivals
of the Church. Six, therefore, of his eclogues, to meet the demands
of ancient custom, are, in fact, dialogues of the simplest kind,
represented at Christmas and Easter, or during Carnival and Lent; in
one of which the manger at Bethlehem is introduced, and in another a
sepulchral monument, setting forth the burial of the Saviour, while
all of them seem to have been enacted in the chapel of the Duke of
Alva, though two certainly are not very religious in their tone and
character.</p>

<p>The remaining five are altogether secular; three of them having
a sort of romantic story, the fourth introducing a shepherd so
desperate with love that he kills himself, and the fifth exhibiting a
market-day farce and riot between sundry country people and students,
the materials for which Enzina may well enough have gathered during
his own life at Salamanca. These five eclogues, therefore, connect
themselves with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span>
coming secular drama of Spain in a manner not to be mistaken, just as
the first six look back towards the old religious exhibitions of the
country.</p>

<p>The other circumstance that should be noted in relation to them,
as proof that they constitute the commencement of the Spanish secular
drama, is, that they were really acted. Nearly all of them speak
in their titles of this fact, mentioning sometimes the personages
who were present, and in more than one instance alluding to Enzina
himself, as if he had performed some of the parts in person. Rojas, a
great authority in whatever relates to the theatre, declares the same
thing expressly, coupling the fall of Granada and the achievements of
Columbus with the establishment of the theatre in Spain by Enzina;
events which, in the true spirit of his profession as an actor, he
seems to consider of nearly equal importance.<a id="FNanchor_438"
href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The precise year
when this happened is given by a learned antiquary of the time of
Philip the Fourth, who says, “In 1492, companies began to represent
publicly in Castile plays by Juan de la Enzina.”<a id="FNanchor_439"
href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> From this year, then,
the great year of the discovery of America, we may safely date the
foundation of the Spanish secular theatre.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the “Representations,” as
he calls them, of Juan de la Enzina have much dramatic merit. On
the contrary, they are rude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p.
278]</span> and slight. Some have only two or three interlocutors,
and no pretension to a plot; and none has more than six personages,
nor any thing that can be considered a proper dramatic structure. In
one of those prepared for the Nativity, the four shepherds are, in
fact, the four Evangelists;—Saint John, at the same time, shadowing
forth the person of the poet. He enters first, and discourses, in
rather a vainglorious way, of himself as a poet; not forgetting,
however, to compliment the Duke of Alva, his patron, as a person
feared in France and in Portugal, with which countries the political
relations of Spain were then unsettled. Matthew, who follows, rebukes
John for this vanity, telling him that “all his works are not worth
two straws”; to which John replies, that, in pastorals and graver
poetry, he defies competition, and intimates, that, in the course of
the next May, he shall publish what will prove him to be something
even more than bucolic. They both agree that the Duke and Duchess
are excellent masters, and Matthew wishes that he, too, were in
their service. At this point of the dialogue, Luke and Mark come in,
and, with slight preface, announce the birth of the Saviour as the
last news. All four then talk upon that event at large, alluding to
John’s Gospel as if already known, and end with a determination to
go to Bethlehem, after singing a <i>villancico</i> or rustic song, which
is much too light in its tone to be religious.<a id="FNanchor_440"
href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The whole eclogue is
short and comprised in less than forty rhymed stanzas of nine lines
each, including a wild lyric at the end, which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> has a chorus to every stanza, and is not
without the spirit of poetry.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441"
class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>This belongs to the class of Enzina’s religious dramas. One, on the
other hand, which was represented at the conclusion of the Carnival,
during the period then called popularly at Salamanca <i>Antruejo</i>,
seems rather to savor of heathenism, as the festival itself did.<a
id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> It
is merely a rude dialogue between four shepherds. It begins with a
description of one of those mummings, common at the period when Enzina
lived, which, in this case, consisted of a mock battle in the village
between Carnival and Lent, ending with the discomfiture of Carnival;
but the general matter of the scene presented is a somewhat free
frolic of eating and drinking among the four shepherds, ending, like
the rest of the eclogues, with a <i>villancico</i>, in which Antruejo, it
is not easy to tell why, is treated as a saint.<a id="FNanchor_443"
href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Quite opposite to both of the pieces already noticed is the
Representation for Good Friday, between two hermits, Saint Veronica,
and an angel. It opens with the meeting and salutation of the two
hermits, the elder of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p.
280]</span> whom, as they walk along, tells the younger, with great
grief, that the Saviour has been crucified that very day, and agrees
with him to visit the sepulchre. In the midst of their talk, Saint
Veronica joins them, and gives an account of the crucifixion, not
without touches of a simple pathos; showing, at the same time, the
napkin on which the portrait of the Saviour had been miraculously
impressed, as she wiped from his face the sweat of his agony. Arrived
at the sepulchre,—which was some kind of a monument for the Corpus
Christi in the Duke of Alva’s chapel, where the representation took
place,—they kneel; an angel whom they find there explains to them
the mystery of the Saviour’s death; and then, in a <i>villancico</i> in
which all join, they praise God, and take comfort with the promise
of the resurrection.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444"
class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>But the nearest approach to a dramatic composition made by Juan
de la Enzina is to be found in two eclogues between “The Esquire
that turns Shepherd,” and “The Shepherds that turn Courtiers”;
both of which should be taken together and examined as one whole,
though, in his simplicity, the poet makes them separate and
independent of each other.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445"
class="fnanchor">[445]</a> In the first, a shepherdess, who is a
coquette, shows herself well disposed to receive Mingo, one of the
shepherds, for her lover, till a certain gay esquire presents himself,
whom, after a fair discussion, she prefers to accept, on condition
he will turn shepherd;—an unceremonious transformation, with which,
and the customary <i>villancico</i>, the piece<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span> concludes. The second eclogue, however,
at its opening, shows the esquire already tired of his pastoral life,
and busy in persuading all the shepherds, somewhat in the tone of
Touchstone in “As you like it,” to go to court, and become courtly.
In the dialogue that follows, an opportunity occurs, which is not
neglected, for a satire on court manners, and for natural and graceful
praise of life in the country. But the esquire carries his point.
They change their dresses, and set forth gayly upon their adventures,
singing, by way of finale, a spirited <i>villancico</i> in honor of the
power of Love, that can thus transform shepherds to courtiers, and
courtiers to shepherds.</p>

<p>The most poetical passage in the two eclogues is one in which Mingo,
the best of the shepherds, still unpersuaded to give up his accustomed
happy life in the country, describes its cheerful pleasures and
resources, with more of natural feeling, and more of a pastoral air,
than are found anywhere else in these singular dialogues.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Both pieces, like the preceding translation, are in double
<i>redondillas</i> forming octave stanzas of eight-syllable verses; and as
the two together contain about four hundred and fifty lines, their
amount is sufficient to show the direction Enzina’s talent naturally
took, as well as the height to which it rose.</p>

<p>Enzina, however, is to be regarded not only as the founder of the
Spanish theatre, but as the founder of the Portuguese, whose first
attempts were so completely imitated from his, and had in their turn
so considerable an effect on the Spanish stage, that they necessarily
become a part of its history. These attempts were made by Gil Vicente,
a gentleman of good family, who was bred to the law, but left that
profession early and devoted himself to dramatic compositions, chiefly
for the entertainment of the families of Manuel the Great and John the
Third. When he was born is not known, but he died in 1557. As a writer
for the stage he flourished from 1502 to 1536,<a id="FNanchor_447"
href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> and produced, in all,
forty-two pieces, arranged as works of devotion, comedies, tragi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span>comedies, and farces;
but most of them, whatever be their names, are in fact short, lively
dramas, or religious pastorals. Taken together, they are better than
any thing else in Portuguese dramatic literature.</p>

<p>The first thing, however, that strikes us in relation to them is,
that their air is so Spanish, and that so many of them are written
in the Spanish language. Of the whole number, ten are in Castilian,
fifteen partly or chiefly so, and seventeen entirely in Portuguese.
Why this is the case, it is not easy to determine. The languages
are, no doubt, very nearly akin to each other; and the writers of
each nation, but especially those of Portugal, have not unfrequently
distinguished themselves in the use of both. But the Portuguese have
never, at any period, admitted their language to be less rich or
less fitted for all kinds of composition than that of their prouder
rivals. Perhaps, therefore, in the case of Vicente, it was, that
the courts of the two countries had been lately much connected by
intermarriages; that King Manuel had been accustomed to have Castilians
about his person to amuse him;<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448"
class="fnanchor">[448]</a> that the queen was a Spaniard;<a
id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> or
that, in language as in other things, he found it convenient thus to
follow the leading of his master, Juan de la Enzina;—but, whatever may
have been the cause, it is certain that Vicente, though he was born and
lived in Portugal, is to be numbered among Spanish authors as well as
among Portuguese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[p. 284]</span>His earliest
effort was made in 1502, on occasion of the birth of Prince John,
afterwards John the Third.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450"
class="fnanchor">[450]</a> It is a monologue in Spanish, a little more
than a hundred lines long, spoken before the king, the king’s mother,
and the Duchess of Braganza, probably by Vicente himself, in the person
of a herdsman, who enters the royal chambers, and, after addressing the
queen mother, is followed by a number of shepherds, bringing presents
to the new-born prince. The poetry is simple, fresh, and spirited, and
expresses the feelings of wonder and admiration that would naturally
rise in the mind of such a rustic, on first entering a royal residence.
Regarded as a courtly compliment, the attempt succeeded. In a modest
notice, attached to it by the son of Vicente, we are told, that,
being the first of his father’s compositions, and the first dramatic
representation ever made in Portugal, it pleased the queen mother so
much, as to lead her to ask its author to repeat it at Christmas,
adapting it to the birth of the Saviour.</p>

<p>Vicente, however, understood that the queen desired to have
such an entertainment as she had been accus<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span>tomed to enjoy at the court of Castile,
when John de la Enzina brought his contributions to the Christmas
festivities. He therefore prepared for Christmas morning what he
called an “Auto Pastoril,” or Pastoral Act;—a dialogue in which four
shepherds with Luke and Matthew are the interlocutors, and in which
not only the eclogue forms of Enzina are used, and the manger of
Bethlehem is introduced, just as that poet had introduced it, but in
which his verses are freely imitated. This effort, too, pleased the
queen, and again, on the authority of his son, we are told she asked
Vicente for another composition, to be represented on Twelfth Night,
1503. Her request was not one to be slighted; and in the same way
four other pastorals followed for similar devout occasions, making,
when taken together, six; all of which being in Spanish, and all
religious pastorals, represented with singing and dancing before King
Manuel, his queen, and other distinguished personages, they are to be
regarded throughout as imitations of Juan de la Enzina’s eclogues.<a
id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Of these six pieces, three of which, we know, were written in
1502 and 1503, and the rest, probably, soon afterwards, the most
curious and characteristic is the one called “The Auto of the Sibyl
Cassandra,” which was represented in the rich old monastery of
Enxobregas, on a Christmas morning, before the queen mother. It is an
eclogue in Spanish, above eight hundred lines<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span> long, and is written in the stanzas most
used by Enzina. Cassandra, the heroine, devoted to a pastoral life,
yet supposed to be a sort of lay prophetess who has had intimations
of the approaching birth of the Saviour, enters at once on the scene,
where she remains to the end, the central point, round which the other
seven personages are not inartificially grouped. She has hardly avowed
her resolution not to be married, when Solomon appears making love to
her, and telling her, with great simplicity, that he has arranged every
thing with her aunts, to marry her in three days. Cassandra, nothing
daunted at the annunciation, persists in the purpose of celibacy; and
he, in consequence, goes out to summon these aunts to his assistance.
During his absence, she sings the following song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">They say, “’T is time, go, marry! go!”</p>
<p class="i0">But I’ll no husband! not I! no!</p>
<p class="i0">For I would live all carelessly,</p>
<p class="i0">Amidst these hills, a maiden free,</p>
<p class="i0">And never ask, nor anxious be,</p>
<p class="i2">Of wedded weal or woe.</p>
<p class="i0">Yet still they say, “Go, marry! go!”</p>
<p class="i0">But I’ll no husband! not I! no!</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">So, mother, think not I shall wed,</p>
<p class="i0">And through a tiresome life be led,</p>
<p class="i0">Or use, in folly’s ways instead,</p>
<p class="i2">What grace the heavens bestow.</p>
<p class="i0">Yet still they say, “Go, marry! go!”</p>
<p class="i0">But I’ll no husband! not I! no!</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">The man has not been born, I ween,</p>
<p class="i0">Who as my husband shall be seen;</p>
<p class="i0">And since what frequent tricks have been</p>
<p class="i2">Undoubtingly I know,</p>
<p class="i0">In vain they say, “Go, marry! go!”</p>
<p class="i0">For I’ll no husband! not I! no!<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span>The aunts, named
Cimeria, Peresica, and Erutea, who are, in fact, the Cumæan, Persian,
and Erythræan Sibyls, now come in with King Solomon and endeavour to
persuade Cassandra to consent to his love; setting forth his merits and
pretensions, his good looks, his good temper, and his good estate. But,
as they do not succeed, Solomon, in despair, goes for her three uncles,
Moses, Abraham, and Isaiah, with whom he instantly returns, all four
dancing a sort of mad dance as they enter, and singing,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">She is wild! She is wild!</p>
<p class="i0">Who shall speak to the child?</p>
<p class="i2">On the hills pass her hours,</p>
<p class="i0">As a shepherdess free;</p>
<p class="i2">She is fair as the flowers,</p>
<p class="i0">She is wild as the sea!</p>
<p class="i0">She is wild! She is wild!</p>
<p class="i0">Who shall speak to the child?<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>The three uncles first endeavour to bribe their niece into a more
teachable temper; but, failing in that, Moses undertakes to show her,
from his own history of the creation, that marriage is an honorable
sacrament and that she ought to enter into it. Cassandra replies,
and, in the course of a rather jesting discussion with Abraham about
good-tempered husbands, intimates that she is aware the Saviour is soon
to be born of a virgin; an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p.
288]</span> augury which the three Sibyls, her aunts, prophetically
confirm, and to which Cassandra then adds that she herself has hopes
to be this Saviour’s mother. The uncles, shocked at the intimation,
treat her as a crazed woman, and a theological and mystical discussion
follows, which is carried on by all present, till a curtain is suddenly
withdrawn, and the manger of Bethlehem and the child are discovered,
with four angels, who sing a hymn in honor of his birth. The rest of
the drama is taken up with devotions suited to the occasion, and it
ends with the following graceful <i>cancion</i> to the Madonna, sung and
danced by the author, as well as the other performers:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The maid is gracious all and fair;</p>
<p class="i0">How beautiful beyond compare!</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">Say, sailor bold and free,</p>
<p class="i0">That dwell’st upon the sea,</p>
<p class="i0">If ships or sail or star</p>
<p class="i2">So winning are.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And say, thou gallant knight,</p>
<p class="i0">That donn’st thine armour bright,</p>
<p class="i0">If steed or arms or war</p>
<p class="i2">So winning are.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And say, thou shepherd hind,</p>
<p class="i0">That bravest storm and wind,</p>
<p class="i0">If flocks or vales or hill afar</p>
<p class="i2">So winning are.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>And so ends this incongruous drama;<a id="FNanchor_455"
href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> a strange<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span> union of the spirit of an
ancient mystery and of a modern <i>vaudeville</i>, but not without poetry,
and not more incongruous or more indecorous than the similar dramas
which, at the same period, and in other countries, found a place in
the princely halls of the most cultivated, and were listened to with
edification in monasteries and cathedrals by the most religious.</p>

<p>Vicente, however, did not stop here. He took counsel of his
success, and wrote dramas which, without skill in the construction
of their plots, and without any idea of conforming to rules of
propriety or taste, are yet quite in advance of what was known on the
Spanish or Portuguese theatre at the time. Such is the “Comedia,”
as it is called, of “The Widower,”—<i>O Viudo</i>,—which was acted
before the court in 1514.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456"
class="fnanchor">[456]</a> It opens with the grief of the widower,
a merchant of Burgos, on the loss of an affectionate and faithful
wife, for which he is consoled, first by a friar, who uses religious
considerations, and afterwards by a gossiping neighbour, who,
being married to a shrew, assures his friend, that, after all,
it is not probable his loss is very great.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span> The two daughters of the disconsolate
widower, however, join earnestly with their father in his mourning;
but their sorrows are mitigated by the appearance of a noble lover who
conceals himself in the disguise of a herdsman, in order to be able to
approach them. His love is very sincere and loyal; but, unhappily, he
loves them both, and hardly addresses either separately. His trouble is
much increased and brought to a crisis by the father, who comes in and
announces that one of his daughters is to be married immediately, and
the other probably in the course of a week. In his despair, the noble
lover calls on death; but insists, that, as long as he lives, he will
continue to serve them both faithfully and truly. At this juncture, and
without any warning, as it is impossible that he should marry both,
he proposes to the two ladies to draw lots for him; a proposition
which they modify by begging the Prince John, then a child twelve
years old and among the audience, to make a decision on their behalf.
The prince decides in favor of the elder, which seems to threaten new
anxieties and troubles, till a brother of the disguised lover appears
and consents to marry the remaining lady. Their father, at first
disconcerted, soon gladly accedes to the double arrangement, and the
drama ends with the two weddings and the exhortations of the priest who
performs the ceremony.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is not a plot, but it is an approach to one. The
“Rubena,” acted in 1521, comes still nearer,<a id="FNanchor_457"
href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and so do “Don
Duardos,” founded on the romance of “Palmerin,” and “Amadis of Gaul,”<a
id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
founded on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span>
romance of the same name, both of which bring a large number of
personages on the stage, and, if they have not a proper dramatic
action, yet give, in much of their structure, intimations of the
Spanish heroic drama, as it was arranged half a century later.
On the other hand, the “Templo d’ Apollo,”<a id="FNanchor_459"
href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> acted in 1526, in
honor of the marriage of the Portuguese princess to the Emperor
Charles the Fifth, belongs to the same class with the allegorical
plays subsequently produced in Spain; the three <i>Autos</i> on the three
ships that carried souls to Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven, evidently
gave Lope de Vega the idea and some of the materials for one of
his early moral plays;<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460"
class="fnanchor">[460]</a> and the <i>Auto</i> in which Faith explains
to the shepherds the origin and mysteries of Christianity<a
id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
might, with slight alterations, have served<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span> for one of the processions of the
Corpus Christi at Madrid, in the time of Calderon. All of them, it
is true, are extremely rude; but nearly all contain elements of the
coming drama, and some of them, like “Don Duardos,” which is longer
than a full-length play ordinarily is, are quite long enough to show
what was their dramatic tendency. But the real power of Gil Vicente
does not lie in the structure or the interest of his stories. It
lies in his poetry, of which, especially in the lyrical portions of
his dramas, there is much.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462"

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Vicente, in Portugal, was thus
giving an impulse to Spanish dramatic literature, which, considering
the intimate connection of the two countries and their courts, can
hardly have been unfelt in Spain at the time, and was certainly
recognized there afterwards, scarcely any thing was done in Spain
itself. During the five-and-twenty years that followed the first
appearance of Juan de la Enzina, no other dramatic poet seems to have
been encouraged or demanded. He was sufficient to satisfy the rare
wants of his royal and princely patrons; and, as we have seen, in both
countries, the drama continued to be a courtly amusement, confined
to a few persons of the highest rank. The commander Escriva, who
lived at this time and is the author of a few beautiful verses found
in the oldest Cancioneros,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463"
class="fnanchor">[463]</a> wrote, indeed, a dialogue, partly<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> in prose and partly
in verse, in which he introduces several interlocutors and brings
a complaint to the god of Love against his lady. But the whole is
an allegory, occasionally graceful and winning from its style, but
obviously not susceptible of representation; so that there is no reason
to suppose it had any influence on a class of compositions already
somewhat advanced. A similar remark may be added about a translation of
the “Amphitryon” of Plautus, made into terse Spanish prose by Francisco
de Villalobos, physician to Ferdinand the Catholic and Charles the
Fifth, which was first printed in 1515, but which it is not at all
probable was ever acted.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464"
class="fnanchor">[464]</a> These, however, are the only attempts made
in Spain or Portugal before 1517, except those of Enzina and Vicente,
which need to be referred to at all.</p>

<p>But in 1517, or a little earlier, a new movement was felt in the
difficult beginnings of the Spanish drama; and it is somewhat singular,
that, as the last came from Portugal, the present one came from
Italy. It came, however, from two Spaniards. The first of them is the
anonymous author of the “Question of Love,” a fiction to be noticed
hereafter, which was finished at Ferrara in 1512, and which contains an
eclogue of respectable poetical merit, that seems<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span> undoubtedly to have been represented
before the court of Naples.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465"
class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>The other, a person of more consequence in the history of the
Spanish drama, is Bartolomé de Torres Naharro, born at Torres, near
Badajoz, on the borders of Portugal, who, after he had been for some
time a captive in Algiers, was redeemed, and visited Rome, hoping to
find favor at the court of Leo the Tenth. This must have been after
1513, and was, of course, at the time when Juan de la Enzina resided
there. But Naharro, by a satire against the vices of the court, made
himself obnoxious at Rome, and fled to Naples, where he lived for
some time under the protection of the noble-minded Fabricio Colonna,
and where, at last, we lose sight of him. He died in poverty.<a
id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>His works, first published by himself at Naples in 1517,
and dedicated to a noble Spaniard, Don Fernando Davalos, a
lover of letters,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467"
class="fnanchor">[467]</a> who had married Victoria Colonna,
the poetess, are entitled “Propaladia,” or “The Firstlings
of his Genius.”<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468"
class="fnanchor">[468]</a> They consist of satires, epistles, ballads,
a Lamentation for King Ferdinand, who died in 1516, and some other
miscellaneous poetry; but chiefly of eight plays, which he calls
“Comedias,” and which fill almost the whole volume.<a id="FNanchor_469"
href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> He was well
situated for making an at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p.
296]</span>tempt to advance the drama, and partly succeeded in it.
There was, at the time he wrote, a great literary movement in Italy,
especially at the court of Rome. The representations of plays, he tells
us, were much resorted to,<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470"
class="fnanchor">[470]</a> and, though he may not have known it,
Trissino had, in 1515, written the first regular tragedy in the
Italian language, and thus given an impulse to dramatic literature,
which it never afterwards entirely lost.<a id="FNanchor_471"
href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>The eight plays of Naharro, however, do not afford much proof
of a familiarity with antiquity, or of a desire to follow ancient
rules or examples; but their author gives us a little theory of his
own upon the subject of the drama, which is not without good sense.
Horace, he says, requires five acts to a play, and he thinks this
reasonable; though he looks upon the pauses they make rather as
convenient resting-places than any thing else, and calls them, not
acts, but “Jornadas,” or days.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472"
class="fnanchor">[472]</a> As to the number of persons, he would have
not less than six, nor more than twelve; and as to that sense of
propriety which refuses to introduce materials into the subject that do
not belong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span> to it,
or to permit the characters to talk and act inconsistently, he holds
it to be as indispensable as the rudder to a ship. This is all very
well.</p>

<p>Besides this, his plays are all in verse, and all open with a sort
of prologue, which he calls “Introyto,” generally written in a rustic
and amusing style, asking the favor and attention of the audience, and
giving hints concerning the subject of the piece that is to follow.</p>

<p>But when we come to the dramas themselves, though we find a decided
advance, in some respects, beyond any thing that had preceded them,
in others we find great rudeness and extravagance. Their subjects are
very various. One of them, the “Soldadesca,” is on the Papal recruiting
service at Rome. Another, the “Tinelaria,” or Servants’ Dining-Hall,
is on such riots as were likely to happen in the disorderly service
of a cardinal’s household; full of revelry and low life. Another,
“La Jacinta,” gives us the story of a lady who lives at her castle
on the road to Rome, where she violently detains sundry passengers
and chooses a husband among them. And of two others, one is on
the adventures of a disguised prince, who comes to the court of a
fabulous king of Leon, and wins his daughter after the fashion of the
old romances of chivalry;<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473"
class="fnanchor">[473]</a> and the other on the adventures of a child
stolen in infancy, which involve disguises in more humble life.<a
id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>How various were the modes in which these subjects were thrown into
action and verse, and, indeed, how different was the character of his
different dramas, may be best understood by a somewhat ampler notice of
the two not yet mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span>The first of
these, the “Trofea,” is in honor of King Manuel of Portugal, and the
discoveries and conquests that were made in India and Africa, under
his auspices; but it is very meagre and poor. After the prologue,
which fills above three hundred verses, Fame enters in the first act
and announces, that the great king has, in his most holy wars, gained
more lands than are described by Ptolemy; whereupon Ptolemy appears
instantly, by especial permission of Pluto, from the regions of
torment, and denies the fact; but, after a discussion, is compelled
to admit it, though with a saving clause for his own honor. In the
second act, two shepherds come upon the stage to sweep it for the
king’s appearance. They make themselves quite merry, at first, with
the splendor about them, and one of them sits on the throne, and
imitates grotesquely the curate of his village; but they soon quarrel,
and continue in bad humor, till a royal page interferes and compels
them to go on and arrange the apartment. The whole of the third act is
taken up with the single speech of an interpreter, bringing in twenty
Eastern and African kings who are unable to speak for themselves, but
avow, through his very tedious harangue, their allegiance to the crown
of Portugal; to all which the king makes no word of reply. The next
act is absurdly filled with a royal reception of four shepherds, who
bring him presents of a fox, a lamb, an eagle, and a cock, which they
explain with some humor and abundance of allegory; but to all which he
makes as little reply as he did to the proffered fealty of the twenty
heathen kings. In the fifth and last act, Apollo gives verses, in
praise of the king, queen, and prince, to Fame, who distributes copies
to the audience; but, refusing them to one of the shepherds, has a
riotous dispute with him. The shepherd tauntingly<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span> offers Fame to spread the praises of King
Manuel through the world as well as she does, if she will but lend him
her wings. The goddess consents. He puts them on and attempts to fly,
but falls headlong on the stage, with which poor practical jest and a
<i>villancico</i> the piece ends.</p>

<p>The other drama, called “Hymenea,” is better, and gives intimations
of what became later the foundations of the national theatre. Its
“Introyto,” or prologue, is coarse, but not without wit, especially in
those parts which, according to the peculiar toleration of the times,
were allowed to make free with religion, if they but showed sufficient
reverence for the Church. The story is entirely invented, and may be
supposed to have passed in any city of Spain. The scene opens in front
of the house of Febea, the heroine, before daylight, where Hymeneo, the
hero, after making known his love for the lady, arranges with his two
servants to give her a serenade the next night. When he is gone, the
servants discuss their own position, and Boreas, one of them, avows
his desperate love for Doresta, the heroine’s maid; a passion which,
through the rest of the piece, becomes the running caricature of his
master’s. But at this moment the Marquis, a brother of Febea, comes
with his servants into the street, and, by the escape of the others,
who fly immediately, has little doubt that there has been love-making
about the house, and goes away determined to watch more carefully. Thus
ends the first act, which might furnish materials for many a Spanish
comedy of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In the second act, Hymeneo enters with his servants and musicians,
and they sing a <i>cancion</i> which reminds us of the sonnet in Molière’s
“Misantrope,” and a <i>villancico</i> which is but little better. Febea then
appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span> in the
balcony, and after a conversation, which, for its substance and often
for its graceful manner, might have been in Calderon’s “Dar la Vida por
su Dama,” she promises to receive her lover the next night. When she is
gone, the servants and the master confer a little together, the master
showing himself very generous in his happiness; but they all escape at
the approach of the Marquis, whose suspicions are thus fully confirmed,
and who is with difficulty restrained by his page from attacking the
offenders at once.</p>

<p>The next act is devoted entirely to the loves of the servants. It
is amusing, from its caricature of the troubles and trials of their
masters, but does not advance the action at all, The fourth, however,
brings the hero and lover into the lady’s house, leaving his attendants
in the street, who confess their cowardice to one another, and agree
to run away, if the Marquis appears. This happens immediately. They
escape, but leave a cloak, which betrays who they are, and the Marquis
remains undisputed master of the ground at the end of the act.</p>

<p>The last act opens without delay. The Marquis, offended in the
nicest point of Castilian honor,—the very point on which the plots of
so many later Spanish dramas turn,—resolves at once to put both of the
guilty parties to death, though their offence is no greater than that
of having been secretly in the same house together. The lady does not
deny her brother’s right, but enters into a long discussion with him
about it, part of which is touching and effective, but most of it very
tedious; in the midst of all which Hymeneo presents himself, and after
explaining who he is and what are his intentions, and especially after
admitting, that, under the circumstances of the case, the Marquis might
justly have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span> killed
his sister, the whole is arranged for a double wedding of masters and
servants, and closes with a spirited <i>villancico</i> in honor of Love and
his victories.</p>

<p>The two pieces are very different, and mark the extremes of the
various experiments Naharro tried in order to produce a dramatic
effect. “As to the kinds of dramas,” he says, “it seems to me that two
are sufficient for our Castilian language: dramas founded on knowledge,
and dramas founded on fancy.”<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475"
class="fnanchor">[475]</a> The “Trofea,” no doubt, was intended by him
to belong to the first class. Its tone is that of compliment to Manuel,
the really great king then reigning in Portugal; and from a passage
in the third act it is not unlikely that it was represented in Rome
before the Portuguese ambassador, the venerable Tristan d’ Acuña. But
the rude and buffoon shepherds, whose dialogue fills so much of the
slight and poor action, show plainly that he was neither unacquainted
with Enzina and Vicente, nor unwilling to imitate them; while the rest
of the drama—the part that is supposed to contain historical facts—is,
as we have seen, still worse. The “Hymenea,” on the other hand, has a
story of considerable interest, announcing the intriguing plot which
became a principal characteristic of the Spanish theatre afterwards.
It has even the “Gracioso,” or Droll Servant, who makes love to
the heroine’s maid; a character which is also found in Naharro’s
“Serafina,” but which Lope de Vega above a century afterwards claimed,
as if invented by himself.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476"
class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span>What is more
singular, this drama approaches to a fulfilment of the requisitions of
the unities, for it has but one proper action, which is the marriage of
Febea; it does not extend beyond the period of twenty-four hours; and
the whole passes in the street before the house of the lady, unless,
indeed, the fifth act passes within the house, which is doubtful.<a
id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> The
whole, too, is founded on the national manners, and preserves the
national costume and character. The best parts, in general, are the
humorous; but there are graceful passages between the lovers, and
touching passages between the brother and sister. The parody of the
servants, Boreas and Doresta, on the passion of the hero and heroine
is spirited; and in the first scene between them we have the following
dialogue, which might be transferred with effect to many a play of
Calderon:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2"><i>Boreas.</i> &nbsp; O, would to heaven, my lady dear,</p>
<p class="i0">That, at the instant I first looked on thee,</p>
<p class="i0">Thy love had equalled mine!</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Doresta.</i> &nbsp; Well! that’s not bad!</p>
<p class="i0">But still you’re not a bone for me to pick.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Boreas.</i> &nbsp; Make trial of me. Bid me do my best,</p>
<p class="i0">In humble service of my love to thee;</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Doresta.</i> &nbsp; Abuse? How’s that? Can words and ways so kind,</p>
<p class="i0">And full of courtesy, be called abuse?</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Boreas.</i> &nbsp; I’ve done.</p>
<p class="i0">I dare not speak. Your answers are so sharp,</p>

<p>And so she continues till she comes to a plenary confession of being
no less hurt, or in love, herself, than he is.<a id="FNanchor_479"

<p>All the plays of Naharro have a versification remarkably fluent
and harmonious for the period in which he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_480"
href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> and nearly all of
them have passages of easy and natural dialogue, and of spirited
lyrical poetry. But several are very gross; two are absurdly composed
in different languages,—one of them in four, and the other in six;<a
id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> and
all contain abundant proof, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p.
304]</span> their structure and tone, of the rudeness of the age
that produced them. In consequence of their little respect for the
Church, they were soon forbidden by the Inquisition in Spain.<a
id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>That they were represented in Italy before they were printed,<a
id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
and that they were so far circulated before their author gave
them to the press,<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484"
class="fnanchor">[484]</a> as to be already in some degree beyond
his own control, we know on his own authority. He intimates, too,
that a good many of the clergy were present at the representation
of at least one of them.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485"
class="fnanchor">[485]</a> But it is not likely that any of his plays
were acted, except in the same way with Vicente’s and Enzina’s; that
is, before a moderate number of persons in some great man’s house,<a
id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> at
Naples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span> and perhaps
at Rome. They, therefore, did not probably produce much effect at
first on the condition of the drama, so far as it was then developed
in Spain. Their influence came in later, and through the press, when
three editions, beginning with that of 1520, appeared in Seville alone
in twenty-five years, curtailed indeed, and expurgated in the last, but
still giving specimens of dramatic composition much in advance of any
thing then produced in the country.</p>

<p>But though men like Juan de la Enzina, Gil Vicente, and Naharro had
turned their thoughts towards dramatic composition, they seem to have
had no idea of founding a popular national drama. For this we must look
to the next period; since, as late as the end of the reign of Ferdinand
and Isabella, there is no trace of such a theatre in Spain.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Provençal</span> literature appeared in Spain
as early as any portion of the Castilian, with which we have thus
far been exclusively occupied. Its introduction was natural, and,
being intimately connected with the history of political power in
both Provence and Spain, can be at once explained, at least so far
as to account for its prevalence in the quarter of the Peninsula
where, during three centuries, it predominated, and for its large
influence throughout the rest of the country, both at that time and
afterwards.</p>

<p>Provence—or, in other words, that part of the South of France which
extends from Italy to Spain, and which originally obtained its name
in consequence of the consideration it enjoyed as an early and most
important province of Rome—was singularly fortunate, during the latter
period of the Middle Ages, in its exemption from many of the troubles
of those troubled times.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487"
class="fnanchor">[487]</a> While the great movement of the North<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p. 307]</span>ern nations lasted,
Provence was disturbed chiefly by the Visigoths, who soon passed onward
to Spain, leaving few traces of their character behind them, and by
the Burgundians, the mildest of all the Teutonic invaders, who did not
reach the South of France till they had been long resident in Italy,
and, when they came, established themselves at once as the permanent
masters of that tempting country.</p>

<p>Greatly favored in this comparative quiet, which, though sometimes
broken by internal dissension, or by the ineffectual incursions of
their new Arab neighbours, was nevertheless such as was hardly known
elsewhere, and favored no less by a soil and climate almost without
rivals in the world, the civilization and refinement of Provence
advanced faster than those of any other portion of Europe. From the
year 879, a large part of it was fortunately constituted into an
independent government; and, what was very remarkable, it continued
under the same family till 1092, two hundred and thirteen years.<a
id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
During this second period, its territories were again much spared
from the confusion that almost constantly pressed their borders and
threatened their tranquillity; for the troubles that then shook the
North of Italy did not cross the Alps and the Var; the Moorish power,
so far from making new aggressions, maintained itself with difficulty
in Catalonia; and the wars and convulsions in the North of France,
from the time of the first successors of Charlemagne to that of Philip
Augustus, flowed rather in the opposite direction, and furnished, at a
safe distance, occupation for tempers too fierce to endure idleness.</p>

<p>In the course of these two centuries, a language<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span> sprang up in the South
and along the Mediterranean, compounded, according to the proportions
of their power and refinement, from that spoken by the Burgundians and
from the degraded Latin of the country, and slowly and quietly took
the place of both. With this new language appeared, as noiselessly,
about the middle of the tenth century, a new literature, suited to the
climate, the age, and the manners that produced it, and one which, for
nearly three hundred years, seemed to be advancing towards a grace and
refinement such as had not been known since the fall of the Romans.</p>

<p>Thus things continued under twelve princes of the Burgundian race,
who make little show in the wars of their times, but who seem to
have governed their states with a moderation and gentleness not to
have been expected amidst the general disturbance of the world. This
family became extinct, in the male branch, in 1092; and in 1113, the
crown of Provence was transferred, by the marriage of its heir, to
Raymond Berenger, the third Count of Barcelona.<a id="FNanchor_489"
href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> The Provençal poets,
many of whom were noble by birth, and all of whom, as a class, were
attached to the court and its aristocracy, naturally followed their
liege lady, in considerable numbers, from Arles to Barcelona, and
willingly established themselves in her new capital, under a prince
full of knightly accomplishments and yet not disinclined to the arts of
peace.</p>

<p>Nor was the change for them a great one. The Pyrenees made then,
as they make now, no very serious difference between the languages
spoken on their opposite declivities; similarity of pursuits had long
before induced a similarity of manners in the population of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span> Barcelona and Marseilles;
and if the Provençals had somewhat more of gentleness and culture,
the Catalonians, from the share they had taken in the Moorish wars,
possessed a more strongly marked character, and one developed in
more manly proportions.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490"
class="fnanchor">[490]</a> At the very commencement of the twelfth
century, therefore, we may fairly consider a Provençal refinement
to have been introduced into the northeastern corner of Spain;
and it is worth notice, that this is just about the period when,
as we have already seen, the ultimately national school of poetry
began to show itself in quite the opposite corner of the Peninsula,
amidst the mountains of Biscay and Asturias.<a id="FNanchor_491"
href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Political causes, however, similar to those which first brought the
spirit of Provence from Arles and Marseilles to Barcelona, soon carried
it farther onward towards the centre of Spain. In 1137, the Counts of
Barcelona obtained by marriage the kingdom of Aragon; and though they
did not, at once, remove the seat of their government to Saragossa,
they early spread through their new territories some of the refinement
for which they were indebted to Provence. This remarkable family,
whose power was now so fast stretching up to the North, possessed, at
different times, during nearly three centuries, different portions
of territory on both sides of the Pyrenees, generally maintaining
a control over a large part of the Northeast of Spain and of the
South of France. Between 1229 and 1253, the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span> most distinguished of its members gave
the widest extent to its empire by broad conquests from the Moors; but
later the power of the kings of Aragon became gradually circumscribed,
and their territory diminished, by marriages, successions, and military
disasters. Under eleven princes, however, in the direct line, and three
more in the indirect, they maintained their right to the kingdom, down
to the year 1479, when, in the person of Ferdinand, it was united to
Castile, and the solid foundations were laid on which the Spanish
monarchy has ever since rested.</p>

<p>With this slight outline of the course of political power in the
northeastern part of Spain, it will be easy to trace the origin and
history of the literature that prevailed there from the beginning
of the twelfth to the middle of the fifteenth century; a literature
which was introduced from Provence, and retained the Provençal
character, till it came in contact with that more vigorous spirit
which, during the same period, had been advancing from the northwest,
and afterwards succeeded in giving its tone to the literature of
the consolidated monarchy.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492"
class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>The character of the old Provençal poetry is the same on both
sides of the Pyrenees. In general, it is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span> graceful and devoted to love; but
sometimes it becomes involved in the politics of the time, and
sometimes it runs into a severe and unbecoming satire. In Catalonia,
as well as in its native home, it belonged much to the court; and
the highest in rank and power are the earliest and foremost on its
lists. Thus, both the princes who first wore the united crowns of
Barcelona and Provence, and who reigned from 1113 to 1162, are often
set down as Limousin or Provençal poets, though with slight claims
to the honor, since not a verse has been published that can be
attributed to either of them.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493"
class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Alfonso the Second, however, who received the crown of Aragon
in 1162, and wore it till 1196, is admitted by all to have been a
Troubadour. Of him we still possess a few not inelegant <i>coblas</i>, or
stanzas, addressed to his lady, which are curious from the circumstance
that they constitute the oldest poem in the modern dialects of Spain,
whose author is known to us; and one that is probably as old, or nearly
as old, as any of the anonymous poetry of Castile and the North.<a
id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Like
the other sovereigns of his age, who loved and practised the art of the
<i>gai saber</i>, Alfonso collected poets about his person. Pierre Rogiers
was at his court, and so were Pierre Raimond de Toulouse, and Aiméric
de Péguilain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span> who
mourned his patron’s death in verse,—all three famous Troubadours
in their time, and all three honored and favored at Barcelona.<a
id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
There can be no doubt, therefore, that a Provençal spirit was already
established and spreading in that part of Spain before the end of the
twelfth century.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the next century, external circumstances
imparted a great impulse to this spirit in Aragon. From 1209 to 1229,
the shameful war which gave birth to the Inquisition was carried
on with extraordinary cruelty and fury against the Albigenses; a
religious sect in Provence accused of heresy, but persecuted rather
by an implacable political ambition. To this sect—which, in some
points, opposed the pretensions of the See of Rome, and was at last
exterminated by a crusade under the Papal authority—belonged nearly
all the contemporary Troubadours, whose poetry is full of their
sufferings and remonstrances.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496"
class="fnanchor">[496]</a> In their great distress, the principal ally
of the Albigenses and Troubadours was Peter the Second of Aragon, who,
in 1213, perished nobly fighting in their cause at the disastrous
battle of Muret. When, therefore, the Troubadours of Provence were
compelled to escape from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p.
313]</span> burnt and bloody ruins of their homes, not a few of them
hastened to the friendly court of Aragon, sure of finding themselves
protected, and their art held in honor, by princes who were, at the
same time, poets.</p>

<p>Among those who thus appeared in Spain in the time of Peter
the Second were Hugues de Saint Cyr;<a id="FNanchor_497"
href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Azémar le Noir;<a
id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
Pons Barba;<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499"
class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Raimond de Miraval, who joined in
the cry urging the king to the defence of the Albigenses, in
which he perished;<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500"
class="fnanchor">[500]</a> and Perdigon,<a id="FNanchor_501"
href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> who, after
being munificently entertained at his court, became, like
Folquet de Marseille,<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502"
class="fnanchor">[502]</a> a traitor to the cause he had espoused, and
openly exulted in the king’s untimely fate. But none of the poetical
followers of Peter the Second did him such honor as the author of the
curious and long poem of “The War of the Albigenses,” in which much
of the king of Aragon’s life is recorded, and a minute account given
of his disastrous death.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503"
class="fnanchor">[503]</a> All, however, except Perdigon and Folquet,
regarded him with gratitude, as their patron, and as a poet,<a
id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
who, to use the language of one of them,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span> made himself “their head and the
head of their honors.”<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505"
class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>The glorious reign of Jayme or James the Conqueror, which
followed, and extended from 1213 to 1276, exhibits the same poetical
character with that of the less fortunate reign of his immediate
predecessor. He protected the Troubadours, and the Troubadours,
in return, praised and honored him. Guillaume Anélier addressed a
<i>sirvente</i> to him as “the young king of Aragon, who defends mercy
and discountenances wrong.”<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506"
class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Nat de Mons sent him two poetical letters,
one of which gives him advice concerning the composition of his
court and government.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507"
class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Arnaud Plagnés offered a <i>chanso</i>
to his fair queen, Eleanor of Castile;<a id="FNanchor_508"
href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and Mathieu de Querci,
who survived the great conqueror, poured forth at his grave the sorrows
of his Christian compatriots at the loss of the great champion on whom
they had depended in their struggle with the Moors.<a id="FNanchor_509"
href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> At the same period,
too, Hugues de Mataplana, a noble Catalan, held at his castle courts of
love and poetical contests, in which he himself bore a large part;<a
id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> while
one of his neighbours, Guillaume de Bergédan, no less distinguished by
poetical talent and ancient descent, but of a less honorable nature,
indulged himself in a style of verse more gross than can easily
be found elsewhere in the Troubadour poetry.<a id="FNanchor_511"
href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> All, however,
the bad and the good,—those who, like Sordel<a id="FNanchor_512"
href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> and Bernard
de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span> Rovenac,<a
id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
satirized the king, and those who, like Pierre Cardenal, enjoyed
his favor and praised him,<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514"
class="fnanchor">[514]</a>—all show that the Troubadours, in his reign,
continued to seek protection in Catalonia and Aragon, where they had so
long been accustomed to find it, and that their poetry was constantly
taking deeper root in a soil where its nourishment was now become so
sure.</p>

<p>James himself has sometimes been reckoned among the
poets of his age.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515"
class="fnanchor">[515]</a> It is possible, though none of his poetry
has been preserved, that he really was such; for metrical composition
was easy in the flowing language he spoke, and it had evidently grown
common at his court, where the examples of his father and grandfather,
as Troubadours, would hardly be without their effect. But however this
may be, he loved letters, and left behind him a large prose work,
more in keeping than any poetry with his character as a wise monarch
and successful conqueror, whose legislation and government were far
in advance of the condition of his subjects.<a id="FNanchor_516"
href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>The work here referred to is a chronicle or commentary on the
principal events of his reign, divided into four parts;—the first of
which is on the troubles that followed his accession to the throne,
after a long minority, with the rescue of Majorca and Minorca from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span> Moors, between
1229 and 1233; the second is on the greater conquest of the kingdom
of Valencia, which was substantially ended in 1239, so that the
hated misbelievers never again obtained any firm foothold in all the
northeastern part of the Peninsula; the third is on the war James
prosecuted in Murcia, till 1266, for the benefit of his kinsman,
Alfonso the Wise, of Castile; and the last is on the embassies
he received from the Khan of Tartary, and Michael Palæologus of
Constantinople, and on his own attempt, in 1268, to lead an expedition
to Palestine, which was defeated by storms. The story, however, is
continued to the end of his reign by slight notices, which, except the
last, preserve throughout the character of an autobiography; the very
last, which, in a few words, records his death at Valencia, being the
only portion written in the third person.</p>

<p>From this Chronicle of James the Conqueror there was early
taken an account of the conquest of Valencia, beginning in the
most simple-hearted manner with the conversation the king held at
Alcañiç (Alcañizas) with Don Blasco de Alagon and the Master of the
Hospitallers, Nuch de Follalquer, who urge him, by his successes in
Minorca, to undertake the greater achievement of the conquest of
Valencia; and ending with the troubles that followed the partition
of the spoils after the fall of that rich kingdom and its capital.
This last work was printed in 1515, in a magnificent volume, where
it serves for an appropriate introduction to the <i>Foros</i>, or
privileges, granted to the city of Valencia from the time of its
conquest down to the end of the reign of Ferdinand the Catholic;<a
id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
but the com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span>plete
work, the Chronicle, did not appear till 1557, when it was published
to satisfy a requisition of Philip the Second.<a id="FNanchor_518"
href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>It is written in a simple and manly style, which, without making
pretensions to elegance, often sets before us the events it records
with a living air of reality, and sometimes shows a happiness in manner
and phraseology which effort seldom reaches. Whether it was undertaken
in consequence of the impulse given to such vernacular histories by
Alfonso the Tenth of Castile, in his “General Chronicle of Spain,” or
whether the intimations which gave birth to that remarkable Chronicle
came rather from Aragon, we cannot now determine. Probably both works
were produced in obedience to the demands of their age; but still, as
both must have been written at nearly the same time, and as the two
kings were united by a family alliance and constant intercourse, a full
knowledge of whatever relates to these two curious records of different
parts of the Peninsula would hardly fail to show us some connection
between them. In that case, it is by no means im<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span>possible that the precedence in point of
time would be found to belong to the Chronicle of the king of Aragon,
who was not only older than Alfonso, but was frequently his wise
and efficient counsellor.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519"
class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>But James of Aragon was fortunate in having yet another chronicler,
Ramon Muntaner, born at Peralada, nine years before the death of that
monarch; a Catalan gentleman, who in his old age, after a life of
great adventure, felt himself to be specially summoned to write an
account of his own times.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520"
class="fnanchor">[520]</a> “For one day,” he says, “being in my
country-house, called Xilvella, in the garden plain of Valencia, and
sleeping in my bed, there came unto me in vision a venerable old
man, clad in white raiment, who said unto me, ‘Arise, and stand on
thy feet, Muntaner, and think how to declare<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span> the great wonders thou hast seen, which
God hath brought to pass in the wars where thou wast; for it hath
seemed well pleasing to Him that through thee should all these things
be made manifest.’” At first, he tells us, he was disobedient to
the heavenly vision, and unmoved by the somewhat flattering reasons
vouchsafed him, why he was elected to chronicle matters so notable.
“But another day, in that same place,” he goes on, “I beheld again that
venerable man, who said unto me, ‘O my son, what doest thou? Why dost
thou despise my commandment? Arise, and do even as I have bidden thee!
And know of a truth, if thou so doest, that thou and thy children and
thy kinsfolk and thy friends shall find favor in the sight of God.’”
Being thus warned a second time, he undertook the work. It was, he
tells us, the fifteenth day of May, 1325, when he began it; and when
it was completed, as it notices events which happened in April, 1328,
it is plain that its composition must have occupied at least three
years.</p>

<p>It opens, with much simplicity, with a record of the
earliest important event he remembered, a visit of the great
conqueror of Valencia at the house of his father, when he was
himself a mere child.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521"
class="fnanchor">[521]</a> The impression of such a visit on a boyish
imagination would naturally be deep;—in the case of Muntaner it seems
to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> been
peculiarly so. From that moment the king became to him, not only the
hero he really was, but something more; one whose very birth was
miraculous, and whose entire life was filled with more grace and favor
than God had ever before shown to living man; for, as the fond old
chronicler will have it, “He was the goodliest prince in the world, and
the wisest and the most gracious and the most upright, and one that was
more loved than any king ever was of all men; both of his own subjects
and strangers, and of noble gentlemen everywhere.”<a id="FNanchor_522"
href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>The life of the Conqueror, however, serves merely as an introduction
to the work; for Muntaner announces his purpose to speak of little
that was not within his own knowledge; and of the Conqueror’s reign he
could remember only the concluding glories. His Chronicle, therefore,
consists chiefly of what happened in the time of four princes of
the same house, and especially of Peter the Third, his chief hero.
He ornaments his story, however, once with a poem two hundred and
forty lines long, which he gave to James the Second, and his son
Alfonso, by way of advice and caution, when the latter was about to
embark for the conquest of Sardinia and Corsica.<a id="FNanchor_523"
href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span>The whole work
is curious, and strongly marked with the character of its author;—a
man brave, loving adventure and show; courteous and loyal; not without
intellectual training, yet no scholar; and, though faithful and
disinterested, either quite unable to conceal, or quite willing, at
every turn, to exhibit, his good-natured personal vanity. His fidelity
to the family of Aragon was admirable. He was always in their service;
often in captivity for them; and engaged at different times in no less
than thirty-two battles in defence of their rights, or in furtherance
of their conquests from the Moors. His life, indeed, was a life of
knightly loyalty, and nearly all the two hundred and ninety-eight
chapters of his Chronicle are as full of its spirit as his heart
was.</p>

<p>In relating what he himself saw and did, his statements seem
to be accurate, and are certainly lively and fresh; but elsewhere
he sometimes falls into errors of date, and sometimes exhibits
a good-natured credulity that makes him believe many of the
impossibilities that were related to him. In his gay spirit and love
of show, as well as in his simple, but not careless, style, he reminds
us of Froissart, especially at the conclusion of the whole Chronicle,
which he ends, evidently to his own satisfaction, with an elaborate
account of the ceremonies observed at the coronation of Alfonso the
Fourth at Saragossa, which he attended in state as syndic of the city
of Valencia; the last event recorded in the work, and the last we hear
of its knightly old author, who was then near his grand climacteric.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the period recorded by this Chronicle, a
change was taking place in the literature of which it is an important
part. The troubles and confusion that prevailed in Provence, from
the time of the cruel persecution of the Albigenses and the en<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span>croaching spirit of
the North, which, from the reign of Philip Augustus, was constantly
pressing down towards the Mediterranean, were more than the genial,
but not hardy, spirit of the Troubadours could resist. Many of them,
therefore, fled; others yielded in despair; and all were discouraged.
From the end of the thirteenth century, their songs are rarely heard
on the soil that gave them birth three hundred years before. With the
beginning of the fourteenth, the purity of their dialect disappears.
A little later, the dialect itself ceases to be cultivated.<a
id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>As might be expected, the delicate plant, whose flower was not
permitted to expand on its native soil, did not long continue to
flourish in that to which it was transplanted. For a time, indeed, the
exiled Troubadours, who resorted to the court of James the Conqueror
and his father, gave to Saragossa and Barcelona something of the
poetical grace that had been so attractive at Arles and Marseilles.
But both these princes were obliged to protect themselves from the
suspicion of sharing the heresy with which so many of the Troubadours
they sheltered were infected; and James, in 1233, among other severe
ordinances, forbade to the laity the Limousin Bible, which had been
recently prepared for them, and the use of which would have tended
so much to confirm their language and form their literature.<a
id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
His successors, however, continued to favor the spirit of the
minstrels of Provence. Peter the Third was numbered amongst them;<a
id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
and if Alfonso the Third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p.
323]</span> and James the Second were not themselves poets, a
poetical spirit was found about their persons and in their court;<a
id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
and when Alfonso the Fourth, the next in succession, was crowned at
Saragossa in 1328, we are told that several poems of Peter, the king’s
brother, were recited in honor of the occasion, one of which consisted
of seven hundred verses.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528"
class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>But these are among the later notices of Provençal literature in
the northeastern part of Spain, where it began now to be displaced by
one taking its hue rather from the more popular and peculiar dialect
of the country. What this dialect was has already been intimated. It
was commonly called the Catalan or Catalonian, from the name of the
country, but probably, at the time of the conquest of Barcelona from
the Moors in 985, differed very little from the Provençal spoken at
Perpignan, on the other side of the Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_529"
href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> As, however, the
Provençal became more cultivated and gentle, the neglected Catalan grew
stronger and ruder; and when the Christian power was extended, in 1118,
to Saragossa, and in 1239 to Valencia, the modifications which<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span> the indigenous
vocabularies underwent, in order to suit the character and condition
of the people, tended rather to confirm the local dialects than to
accommodate them to the more advanced language of the Troubadours.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if the Troubadours had maintained their ascendency in
Provence, their influence would not easily have been overcome in Spain.
At least, there are indications that it would not have disappeared
so soon. Alfonso the Tenth of Castile, who had some of the more
distinguished of them about him, imitated the Provençal poetry, if
he did not write it; and even earlier, in the time of Alfonso the
Ninth, who died in 1214, there are traces of its progress in the heart
of the country, that are not to be mistaken.<a id="FNanchor_530"
href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> But failing in its
strength at home, it failed abroad. The engrafted fruit perished
with the stock from which it was originally taken. After the opening
of the fourteenth century we find no genuinely Provençal poetry in
Castile, and after the middle of that century it begins to recede from
Catalonia and Aragon, or rather to be corrupted by the harsher, but
hardier, dialect spoken there by the mass of the people. Peter the
Fourth, who reigned in Aragon from 1336 to 1387, shows the conflict
and admixture of the two influences in such portions of his poetry as
have been published, as well as in a letter he addressed to his son;<a
id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>—a
confusion, or transition, which we should probably be able to trace
with some distinctness, if we had before us the curious dictionary
of rhymes, still extant in its original manuscript, which<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span> was made at this king’s
command, in 1371, by Jacme March, a member of the poetical family
that was afterwards so much distinguished.<a id="FNanchor_532"
href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> In any event, there
can be no reasonable doubt, that, soon after the middle of the
fourteenth century, if not earlier, the proper Catalan dialect began
to be perceptible in the poetry and prose of its native country.<a

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> failure of the Provençal language,
and especially the failure of the Provençal culture, were not looked
upon with indifference in the countries on either side of the Pyrenees,
where they had so long prevailed. On the contrary, efforts were
made to restore both, first in France, and afterwards in Spain. At
Toulouse, on the Garonne, not far from the foot of the mountains, the
magistrates of the city determined, in 1323, to form a company or guild
for this purpose; and, after some deliberation, constituted it under
the name of the “Sobregaya Companhia dels Sept Trobadors de Tolosa,”
or the Very Gay Company of the Seven Troubadours of Toulouse. This
company immediately sent forth a letter, partly in prose and partly
in verse, summoning all poets to come to Toulouse on the first day of
May in 1324, and there “with joy of heart contend for the prize of
a golden violet,” which should be adjudged to him who should offer
the best poem, suited to the occasion. The concourse was great, and
the first prize was given to a poem in honor of the Madonna by Ramon
Vidal de Besalú, a Catalan gentleman, who seems to have been<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span> the author of the
regulations for the festival, and to have been declared a doctor of the
<i>Gay Saber</i> on the occasion. In 1355, this company formed for itself
a more ample body of laws, partly in prose and partly in verse, under
the title of “Ordenanzas dels Sept Senhors Mantenedors del Gay Saber,”
or Ordinances of the Seven Lords Conservators of the Gay Saber, which,
with the needful modifications, have been observed down to our own
times, and still regulate the festival annually celebrated at Toulouse,
on the first day of May, under the name of the Floral Games.<a
id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>Toulouse was separated from Aragon only by the picturesque range
of the Pyrenees; and similarity of language and old political
connections prevented even the mountains from being a serious
obstacle to intercourse. What was done at Toulouse, therefore, was
soon known at Barcelona, where the court of Aragon generally resided,
and where circumstances soon favored a formal introduction of the
poetical institutions of the Troubadours. John the First, who,
in 1387, succeeded Peter the Fourth, was a prince of more gentle
manners than were common in his time, and more given to festivity and
shows than was, perhaps, consistent with the good of his kingdom,
and certainly more than was suited to the fierce and turbulent
spirit of his nobility.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535"
class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Among his other attributes was a love
of poetry; and in 1388, he despatched a solemn embassy, as if for
an affair of state, to Charles the Sixth of France, praying him to
cause certain poets of the company at Toulouse<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> to visit Barcelona, in order that they
might found there an institution like their own, for the Gay Saber.
In consequence of this mission, two of the seven conservators of the
Floral Games came to Barcelona in 1390, and established what was called
a “Consistory of the Gaya Sciencia,” with laws and usages not unlike
those of the institution they represented. Martin, who followed John on
the throne, increased the privileges of the new Consistory, and added
to its resources; but at his death, in 1409, it was removed to Tortosa,
and its meetings were suspended by troubles that prevailed through the
country, in consequence of a disputed succession.</p>

<p>At length, when Ferdinand the Just was declared king, their meetings
were resumed. Enrique de Villena—whom we must speedily notice as a
nobleman of the first rank in the state, nearly allied to the blood
royal, both of Castile and Aragon—came with the new king to Barcelona
in 1412, and, being a lover of poetry, busied himself while there in
reëstablishing and reforming the Consistory, of which he became, for
some time, the principal head and manager. This was, no doubt, the
period of its greatest glory. The king himself frequently attended
its meetings. Many poems were read by their authors before the
judges appointed to examine them, and prizes and other distinctions
were awarded to the successful competitors.<a id="FNanchor_536"
href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> From this time,
therefore, poetry in the native dialects of the country was held
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span> honor in the
capitals of Catalonia and Aragon. Public poetical contests were, from
time to time, celebrated, and many poets called forth under their
influence during the reign of Alfonso the Fifth and that of John the
Second, which, ending in 1479, was followed by the consolidation of
the whole Spanish monarchy, and the predominance of the Castilian
power and language.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537"
class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>During the period, however, of which we have been speaking, and
which embraces the century before the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,
the Catalan modification of Provençal poetry had its chief success,
and produced all the authors that deserve notice. At its opening,
Zurita, the faithful annalist of Aragon, speaking of the reign of
John the First, says, that, “in place of arms and warlike exercises,
which had formerly been the pastime of princes, now succeeded <i>trobas</i>
and poetry in the mother tongue, with its art, called the ‘Gaya
Sciencia,’ whereof schools began to be instituted”;—schools which, as
he intimates, were so thronged, that the dignity of the art they taught
was impaired by the very numbers devoted to it.<a id="FNanchor_538"
href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Who these poets were
the grave historian does not stop to inform us, but we learn something
of them from another and better source; for, according to the fashion
of the time, a collection of poetry was made a little after the middle
of the fifteenth century, which includes the whole period, and contains
the names, and more or less of the works, of those who were then best
known and most considered. It begins with a grant of assistance to the
Consistory of Barcelona, by Ferdinand the Just, in 1413; and then,
going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span> back as far
as to the time of Jacme March, who, as we have seen, flourished in
1371, presents a series of more than three hundred poems, by about
thirty authors, down to the time of Ausias March, who certainly lived
in 1460, and whose works are, as they well deserve to be, prominent in
the collection.</p>

<p>Among the poets here brought together are Luis de Vilarasa,
who lived in 1416;<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539"
class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Berenguer de Masdovelles, who
seems to have flourished soon after 1453;<a id="FNanchor_540"
href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Jordi, about whom
there has been much discussion, but whom reasonable critics must
place as late as 1450-1460;<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541"
class="fnanchor">[541]</a> and Antonio Vallmanya, some of whose poems
are dated in 1457 and 1458.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542"
class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Besides these, Juan Rocaberti, Fogaçot, and
Guerau, with others apparently of the same period, are contributors
to the collection, so that its whole air is that of the Catalan<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span> and Valencian
imitations of the Provençal Troubadours in the fifteenth century.<a
id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
If, therefore, to this curious Cancionero we add the translation of
the “Divina Commedia” made into Catalan by Andres Febrer in 1428,<a
id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
and the romance of “Tirante the White,” translated into Valencian
by its author, Joannot Martorell,—which Cervantes calls “a treasure
of contentment and a mine of pleasure,”<a id="FNanchor_545"
href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>—we shall have all that
is needful of the peculiar literature of the northeastern part of
Spain during the greater part of the century in which it flourished.
Two authors, however, who most illustrated it, deserve more particular
notice.</p>

<p>The first of them is Ausias or Augustin March. His family,
originally Catalan, went to Valencia at the time of the conquest,
in 1238, and was distinguished, in suc<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span>cessive generations, for the love of
letters. He himself was of noble rank, possessed the seigniory of
the town of Beniarjó and its neighbouring villages, and served in
the Cortes of Valencia in 1446. But, beyond these few facts, we know
little of his life, except that he was an intimate personal friend
of the accomplished and unhappy Prince Carlos of Viana, and that he
died, probably, in 1460,—certainly before 1462,—well deserving the
record made by his contemporary, the Grand Constable of Castile,
that “he was a great Troubadour and a man of a very lofty spirit.”<a
id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>So much of his poetry as has been preserved is dedicated to the
honor of a lady, whom he loved and served in life and in death, and
whom, if we are literally to believe his account, he first saw on a
Good Friday in church, exactly as Petrarch first saw Laura. But this
is probably only an imitation of the great Italian master, whose fame
then overshadowed whatever there was of literature in the world. At
any rate, the poems of March leave no doubt that he was a follower
of Petrarch. They are in form what he calls <i>cants</i>; each of which
generally consists of from five to ten stanzas. The whole collection,
amounting to one hundred and sixteen of these short poems, is divided
into four parts, and comprises ninety-three <i>cants</i> or <i>canzones</i> of
Love, in which he complains much of the falsehood of his mistress,
fourteen moral and didactic <i>canzones</i>, a single spiritual one, and
eight on Death. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span>
though March, in the framework of his poetry, is an imitator of
Petrarch, his manner is his own. It is grave, simple, and direct,
with few conceits, and much real feeling; besides which, he has a
truth and freshness in his expressions, resulting partly from the
dialect he uses, and partly from the tenderness of his own nature,
which are very attractive. No doubt, he is the most successful of
all the Valencian and Catalan poets whose works have come down to
us; but what distinguishes him from all of them, and indeed from the
Provençal school generally, is the sensibility and moral feeling that
pervade so much of what he wrote. By these qualities his reputation
and honors have been preserved in his own country down to the present
time. His works passed through four editions in the sixteenth century,
and enjoyed the honor of being read to Philip the Second, when a
youth, by his tutor; they were translated into Latin and Italian,
and in the proud Castilian were versified by a poet of no less
consequence than Montemayor.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547"
class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>The other poet who should be mentioned in the same relations was a
contemporary of March, and, like him, a native of Valencia. His name
is Jaume or James Roig, and he was physician to Mary, queen<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span> of Alfonso the Fifth of
Aragon. If his own authority is not to be accounted rather poetical
than historical, he was a man of much distinction in his time, and
respected in other countries as well as at home. But if that be set
aside, we know little of him, except that he was one of the persons
who contended for a poetical prize at Valencia in 1474, and that he
died there of apoplexy on the 4th of April, 1478.<a id="FNanchor_548"
href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> His works are not much
better known than his life, though, in some respects, they are well
worthy of notice. Hardly any thing, indeed, remains to us of them,
except the principal one, a poem of three hundred pages, sometimes
called the “Book of Advice,” and sometimes the “Book of the Ladies.”<a
id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> It is
chiefly a satire on women, but the conclusion is devoted to the praise
and glory of the Madonna, and the whole is interspersed with sketches
of himself and his times, and advice to his nephew, Balthazar Bou, for
whose especial benefit the poem seems to have been written.</p>

<p>It is divided into four books, which are subdivided into parts,
little connected with each other, and often little in harmony with
the general subject of the whole. Some of it is full of learning
and learned names, and some of it would seem to be devout, but its
prevailing air is certainly not at all religious. It is written in
short rhymed verses, consisting of from two to five syllables,—an
irregular measure, which has been called <i>cudolada</i>, and one which, as
here used, has been much praised for its sweetness by those who are
familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p. 335]</span> enough
with the principles of its structure to make the necessary elisions
and abbreviations; though to others it can hardly appear better than
whimsical and spirited.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550"
class="fnanchor">[550]</a> The following sketch of himself may be taken
as a specimen of it; and shows that he had as little of the spirit of a
poet as Skelton, with whom, in many respects, he may be compared. Roig
represents himself to have been ill of a fever, when a boy, and to have
hastened from his sick bed into the service of a Catalan freebooting
gentleman, like Roque Guinart or Rocha Guinarda, an historical
personage of the same Catalonia, and of nearly the same period, who
figures in the Second Part of Don Quixote.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The poem, its author tells us, was written in 1460, and we know that
it continued popular long enough to pass through five editions before
1562. But portions of it are so indecent, that, when, in 1735, it was
thought worth while to print it anew, its editor, in order to account
for the large omissions he was obliged to make, resorted to the amusing
expedient of pretending he could find no copy of the old editions
which was not deficient in the passages he left out of his own.<a
id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Of
course, Roig is not much read now. His indecency and the obscurity
of his idiom alike cut him off from the polished portions of Spanish
society; though out of his free and spirited satire much may be gleaned
to illustrate the tone of manners and the modes of living and thinking
in his time.</p>

<p>The death of Roig brings us to the period when the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span> literature of the
eastern part of Spain, along the shores of the Mediterranean, began
to decline. Its decay was the natural, but melancholy, result of
the character of the literature itself, and of the circumstances in
which it was accidentally placed. It was originally Provençal in its
spirit and elements, and had therefore been of quick, rather than of
firm growth;—a gay vegetation, which sprang forth spontaneously with
the first warmth of the spring, and which could hardly thrive in any
other season than the gentle one that gave it birth. As it gradually
advanced, carried by the removal of the seat of political power, from
Aix to Barcelona, and from Barcelona to Saragossa, it was constantly
approaching the literature that had first appeared in the mountains
of the Northwest, whose more vigorous and grave character it was ill
fitted to resist. When, therefore, the two came in contact, there
was but a short struggle for the supremacy. The victory was almost
immediately decided in favor of that which, springing from the elements
of a strong and proud character, destined to vindicate for itself the
political sway of the whole country, was armed with a power to which
its more gay and gracious rival could offer no effective opposition.</p>

<p>The period, when these two literatures, advancing from opposite
corners of the Peninsula, finally met, cannot, from its nature, be
determined with much precision. But, like the progress of each, it was
the result of political causes and tendencies which are obvious and
easily traced. The family that ruled in Aragon had, from the time of
James the Conqueror, been connected with that established in Castile
and the North; and Ferdinand the Just, who was crowned in Saragossa
in 1412, was a Castilian prince; so that, from this period, both
thrones were absolutely filled by members of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span> same royal house; and Valencia and
Burgos, as far as their courts touched and controlled the literature
of either, were to a great degree under the same influences. And this
control was neither slight nor inefficient. Poetry, in that age,
everywhere sought shelter under courtly favor, and in Spain easily
found it. John the Second was a professed and successful patron of
letters; and when Ferdinand came to assume the crown of Aragon, he was
accompanied by the Marquis of Villena, a nobleman whose great fiefs lay
on the borders of Valencia, but who, notwithstanding his interest in
the Southern literature and in the Consistory of Barcelona, yet spoke
the Castilian as his native language, and wrote in no other. We may,
therefore, well believe, that, in the reigns of Ferdinand the Just and
Alfonso the Fifth, between 1412 and 1458, the influence of the North
began to make inroads on the poetry of the South, though it does not
appear that either March or Roig, or any one of their immediate school,
proved habitually unfaithful to his native dialect.</p>

<p>At length, forty years after the death of Villena, we find a decided
proof that the Castilian was beginning to be known and cultivated
on the shores of the Mediterranean. In 1474, a poetical contest was
publicly held at Valencia, in honor of the Madonna;—a sort of literary
jousting, like those so common afterwards in the time of Cervantes
and Lope de Vega. Forty poets contended for the prize. The Viceroy
was present. It was a solemn and showy occasion; and all the poems
offered were printed the same year by Bernardo Fenollar, Secretary of
the meeting, in a volume which is valued as the first book known to
have been printed in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553"
class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Four of these poems are in Castilian.
This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> leaves no
doubt that Castilian verse was now deemed a suitable entertainment for
a popular audience at Valencia. Fenollar, too, who wrote, besides what
appears in this contest, a small volume of poetry on the Passion of
our Saviour, has left us at least one <i>cancion</i> in Castilian, though
his works were otherwise in his native dialect, and were composed
apparently for the amusement of his friends in Valencia, where he
was a person of consideration, and in whose University, founded in
1499, he was a professor.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554"
class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>Probably Castilian poetry was rarely written in Valencia during
the fifteenth century, while, on the other hand, Valencian was
written constantly. “The Suit of the Olives,” for instance, wholly
in that dialect, was composed by Jaume Gazull, Fenollar, and Juan
Moreno, who seem to have been personal friends, and who united their
poetical resources to produce this satire, in which, under the
allegory of olive-trees, and in language not always so modest as
good taste requires, they discuss together the dangers to which the
young and the old are respectively exposed from the solicitations
of worldly pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555"
class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Another dialogue, by the same three poets,
in the same dialect, soon followed, dated in 1497, which is supposed
to have occurred in the bed-chamber of a lady just recovering from
the birth of a child, in which is examined the question whether
young men or old make the best husbands; an inquiry decid<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span>ed by Venus in favor of
the young, and ended, most inappropriately, by a religious hymn.<a
id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Other
poets were equally faithful to their vernacular; among whom were Juan
Escriva, ambassador of the Catholic sovereigns to the Pope, in 1497,
who was probably the last person of high rank that wrote in it;<a
id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
and Vincent Ferrandis, concerned in a poetical contest in honor of
Saint Catherine of Siena, at Valencia, in 1511, whose poems seem, on
other occasions, to have carried off public honors, and to have been,
from their sweetness and power, worthy of the distinction they won.<a
id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>Meantime, Valencian poets are not wanting who wrote more or less in
Castilian. Francisco Castelví, a friend of Fenollar, is one of them.<a
id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
Another is Narcis Viñoles, who flourished in 1500, who wrote in
Tuscan as well as in Castilian and Valencian, and who evidently
thought his native dialect somewhat barbarous.<a id="FNanchor_560"
href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> A third is Juan
Tallante, whose religious poems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p.
341]</span> are found at the opening of the old General Cancionero.<a
id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
A fourth is Luis Crespi, member of the ancient family of Valdaura,
and in 1506 head of the University of Valencia.<a id="FNanchor_562"
href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> And among the latest,
if not the very last, was Fernandez de Heredia, who died in 1549, of
whom we have hardly any thing in Valencian, but much in Castilian.<a
id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
Indeed, that the Castilian, in the early part of the century, had
obtained a real supremacy in whatever there was of poetry and elegant
literature along the shores of the Mediterranean cannot be doubted;
for, before the death of Heredia, Boscan had already deserted his
native Catalonian, and begun to form a school in Spanish literature
that has never since disappeared; and shortly afterwards, Timoneda and
his followers showed, by their successful representation of Castilian
farces in the public squares of Valencia, that the ancient dialect had
ceased to be insisted upon in its own capital. The language of the
court of Castile had, for such purposes, become the prevailing language
of all the South.</p>

<p>This, in fact, was the circumstance that determined the fate of all
that remained in Spain on the foundations of the Provençal refinement.
The crowns of Aragon and Castile had been united by the marriage of
Ferdinand and Isabella; the court had been removed from Saragossa,
though that city still claimed the dignity of being regarded as an
independent capital; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p.
342]</span> with the tide of empire, that of cultivation gradually
flowed down from the West and the North. Some of the poets of the
South have, it is true, in later times, ventured to write in their
native dialects. The most remarkable of them is Vicent Garcia, who
was a friend of Lope de Vega, and died in 1623.<a id="FNanchor_564"
href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> But his poetry, in
all its various phases, is a mixture of several dialects, and shows,
notwithstanding its provincial air, the influence of the court of
Philip the Fourth, where its author for a time lived; while the poetry
printed later, or heard in our own days on the popular theatres of
Barcelona and Valencia, is in a dialect so grossly corrupted, that
it is no longer easy to acknowledge it as that of the descendants
of Muntaner and March.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565"
class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span>The degradation
of the two more refined dialects in the southern and eastern parts of
Spain, which was begun in the time of the Catholic sovereigns, may be
considered as completed when the seat of the national government was
settled, first in Old and afterwards in New Castile; since, by this
circumstance, the prevalent authority of the Castilian was finally
recognized and insured. The change was certainly neither unreasonable
nor ill-timed. The language of the North was already more ample,
more vigorous, and more rich in idiomatic constructions; indeed, in
almost every respect, better fitted to become national than that of
the South. And yet we can hardly follow and witness the results of
such a revolution but with feelings of a natural regret; for the
slow decay and final disappearance of any language bring with them
melancholy thoughts, which are, in some sort, peculiar to the occasion.
We feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span> as if a
portion of the world’s intelligence were extinguished; as if we were
ourselves cut off from a part of the intellectual inheritance, to which
we had in many respects an equal right with those who destroyed it, and
which they were bound to pass down to us unimpaired as they themselves
had received it. The same feeling pursues us even when, as in the case
of the Greek or Latin, the people that spoke it had risen to the full
height of their refinement, and left behind them monuments by which
all future times can measure and share their glory. But our regret is
deeper when the language of a people is cut off in its youth, before
its character is fully developed; when its poetical attributes are just
beginning to appear, and when all is bright with promise and hope.<a
id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>This was singularly the misfortune and the fate of the Provençal
and of the two principal dialects into which it was modified and
moulded. For the Provençal started forth in the darkest period Europe
had seen since Grecian civilization had first dawned on the world. It
kindled, at once, all the South of France with its brightness, and
spread its influence, not only into the neighbouring countries, but
even to the courts of the cold and unfriendly North. It flourished
long, with a tropical rapidity and luxuriance, and gave token, from
the first, of a light-hearted spirit, that promised, in the fulness
of its strength, to produce a poetry, different, no doubt, from that
of antiquity, with which it had no real connection, but yet a poetry
as fresh as the soil from which it sprang, and as genial as the
climate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span> by which it
was quickened. But the cruel and shameful war of the Albigenses drove
the Troubadours over the Pyrenees, and the revolutions of political
power and the prevalence of the spirit of the North crushed them on
the Spanish shores of the Mediterranean. We follow, therefore, with
a natural and inevitable regret, their long and wearisome retreat,
marked as it is everywhere with the wrecks and fragments of their
peculiar poetry and cultivation, from Aix to Barcelona, and from
Barcelona to Saragossa and Valencia, where, oppressed by the prouder
and more powerful Castilian, what remained of the language that gave
the first impulse to poetical feeling in modern times sinks into a
neglected dialect, and, without having attained the refinement that
would preserve its name and its glory to future times, becomes as
much a dead language as the Greek or the Latin.<a id="FNanchor_567"

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Provençal literature, which appeared
so early in Spain, and which, during the greater part of the period
when it prevailed there, was in advance of the poetical culture of
nearly all the rest of Europe, could not fail to exercise an influence
on the Castilian, springing up and flourishing at its side. But, as
we proceed, we must notice the influence of another literature over
the Spanish, less visible and important at first than that of the
Provençal, but destined subsequently to become much wider and more
lasting;—I mean, of course, the Italian.</p>

<p>The origin of this influence is to be traced far back in the history
of the Spanish character and civilization. Long, indeed, before a
poetical spirit had been reawakened anywhere in the South of Europe,
the Spanish Christians, through the wearisome centuries of their
contest with the Moors, had been accustomed to look towards Italy as
to the seat of a power whose foundations were laid in faith and hopes
extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span> far
beyond the mortal struggle in which they were engaged; not because
the Papal See, in its political capacity, had then obtained any wide
authority in Spain, but because, from the peculiar exigencies and
trials of their condition, the religion of the Romish Church had
nowhere found such implicit and faithful followers as the body of the
Spanish Christians.</p>

<p>In truth, from the time of the great Arab invasion down to the
fall of Granada, this devoted people had rarely come into political
relations with the rest of Europe. Engrossed and exhausted by their
wars at home, they had, on the one hand, hardly been at all the
subjects of foreign cupidity or ambition; and, on the other, they had
been little able, even when they most desired it, to connect themselves
with the stirring interests of the world beyond their mountains, or
attract the sympathy of those more favored countries which, with
Italy at their head, were coming up to constitute the civilized power
of Christendom. But the Spaniards always felt their warfare to be
peculiarly that of soldiers of the Cross; they always felt themselves,
beyond every thing else and above every thing else, to be Christian
men contending against misbelief. Their religious sympathies were,
therefore, constantly apparent, and often predominated over all others;
so that, while they were little connected with the Church of Rome by
those political ties that were bringing half Europe into bondage, they
were more connected with its religious spirit than any other people of
modern times; more even than the armies of the Crusaders whom that same
Church had summoned out of all Christendom, and to whom it had given
whatever of its own resources and character it was able to impart.</p>

<p>To these religious influences of Italy upon Spain<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span> were early added those of
a higher intellectual culture. Before the year 1300, Italy possessed
at least five universities; some of them famous throughout Europe, and
attracting students from its most distant countries. Spain, at the
same period, possessed not one, except that of Salamanca, which was
in a very unsettled state.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568"
class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Even during the next century, those
established at Huesca and Valladolid produced comparatively little
effect. The whole Peninsula was still in too disturbed a state for any
proper encouragement of letters; and those persons, therefore, who
wished to be taught, resorted, some of them, to Paris, but more to
Italy. At Bologna, which was probably the oldest, and for a long time
the most distinguished, of the Italian universities, we know Spaniards
were received and honored, during the thirteenth century, both as
students and as professors.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569"
class="fnanchor">[569]</a> At Padua, the next in rank, a Spaniard, in
1260, was made the Rector, or presiding officer.<a id="FNanchor_570"
href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> And, no doubt, in all
the great Italian places of education, which were easily accessible,
especially in those of Rome and Naples, Spaniards early sought the
culture that was either not then to be obtained in their own country,
or to be had only with difficulty or by accident.</p>

<p>In the next century, the instruction of Spaniards in Italy was put
upon a more permanent foundation, by Cardinal Carillo de Albornoz; a
prelate, a statesman, and a soldier, who, as Archbishop of Toledo,
was head of the Spanish Church in the reign of Alfonso the Elev<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span>enth, and who afterwards,
as regent for the Pope, conquered and governed a large part of the
Roman States, which, in the time of Rienzi, had fallen off from their
allegiance. This distinguished personage, during his residence in
Italy, felt the necessity of better means for the education of his
countrymen, and founded, for their especial benefit, at Bologna, in
1364, the College of Saint Clement,—a munificent institution, which has
subsisted down to our own age.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571"
class="fnanchor">[571]</a> From the middle of the fourteenth century,
therefore, it cannot be doubted that the most direct means existed
for the transmission of culture from Italy to Spain; one of the most
striking proofs of which is to be found in the case of Antonio de
Lebrixa, commonly called Nebrissensis, who was educated at this college
in the century following its first foundation, and who, on his return
home, did more to advance the cause of letters in Spain than any
other scholar of his time.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572"
class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>Commercial and political relations still further promoted a free
communication of the manners and literature of Italy to Spain.
Barcelona, long the seat of a cultivated court,—a city whose liberal
institutions had given birth to the first bank of exchange, and
demanded the first commercial code of modern times,—had, from the days
of James the Conqueror, exercised a sensible influence round the shores
of the Mediterranean, and come into successful competition with the
enterprise of Pisa and Genoa, even in the ports of Italy. The knowledge
and refinement its ships brought back, joined to the spirit of
commercial adventure that sent them out, rendered Barcelona, therefore,
in the thirteenth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[p. 350]</span>
fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, one of the most magnificent
cities in Europe, and carried its influence not only quite through the
kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, of which it was in many respects the
capital, but into the neighbouring kingdom of Castile, with which that
of Aragon was, during much of this period, intimately connected.<a
id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>The political relations between Spain and Sicily were, however,
earlier and more close than those between Spain and Italy, and tended
to the same results. Giovanni da Procida, after long preparing his
beautiful island to shake off the hated yoke of the French, hastened,
in 1282, as soon as the horrors of the Sicilian Vespers were fulfilled,
to lay the allegiance of Sicily at the feet of Peter the Third of
Aragon, who, in right of his wife, claimed Sicily to be a part of
his inheritance, as heir of Conradin, the last male descendant
of the imperial family of the Hohenstauffen.<a id="FNanchor_574"
href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The revolution thus
begun by a fiery patriotism was successful; but from that time Sicily
was either a fief of the Aragonese crown, or was possessed, as a
separate kingdom, by a branch of the Aragonese family, down to the
period when, with the other possessions of Ferdinand the Catholic, it
became a part of the consolidated monarchy of Spain.</p>

<p>The connection with Naples, which was of the same sort, followed
later, but was no less intimate. Alfonso the Fifth of Aragon, a prince
of rare wisdom and much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[p.
351]</span> literary cultivation, acquired Naples by conquest in
1441, after a long struggle;<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575"
class="fnanchor">[575]</a> but the crown he had thus won was passed
down separately in an indirect line through four of his descendants,
till 1503, when, by a shameful treaty with France, and by the genius
and arms of Gonzalvo of Córdova, it was again conquered and made
a direct dependence of the Spanish throne.<a id="FNanchor_576"
href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> In this condition, as
fiefs of the crown of Spain, both Sicily and Naples continued subject
kingdoms until after the Bourbon accession; both affording, from the
very nature of their relations to the thrones of Castile and Aragon,
constant means and opportunities for the transmission of Italian
cultivation and Italian literature to Spain itself.</p>

<p>But the language of Italy, from its affinity to the Spanish,
constituted a medium of communication perhaps more important and
effectual than any or all of the others. The Latin was the mother
of both; and the resemblance between them was such, that neither
could claim to have features entirely its own: <i>Facies non una, nec
diversa tamen; qualem decet esse sororum</i>. It cost little labor to
the Spaniard to make himself master of the Italian. Translations,
therefore, were less common from the few Italian authors that then
existed, worth translating, than they would otherwise have been; but
enough are found, and early enough, to show that Italian authors and
Italian literature were not neglected in Spain. Ayala, the chronicler,
who died in 1407, was, as we have already observed, acquainted with
the works of Boccaccio.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577"
class="fnanchor">[577]</a> A little later, we are struck by<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span> the fact that the “Divina
Commedia” of Dante was twice translated in the same year, 1428; once
by Febrer into the Catalan dialect, and once by Don Enrique de Villena
into the Castilian. Twenty years afterwards, the Marquis of Santillana
is complimented as a person capable of correcting or surpassing
that great poet, and speaks himself of Dante, of Petrarch, and of
Boccaccio as if he were familiar with them all.<a id="FNanchor_578"
href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> But the name of this
great nobleman brings us at once to the times of John the Second, when
the influences of Italian literature and the attempt to form an Italian
school in Spain are not to be mistaken. To this period, therefore, we
now turn.</p>

<p>The long reign of John the Second, extending from 1407 to 1454,
unhappy as it was for himself and for his country, was not unfavorable
to the progress of some of the forms of elegant literature. During
nearly the whole of it, the weak king himself was subjected to the
commanding genius of the Constable Alvaro de Luna, whose control,
though he sometimes felt it to be oppressive, he always regretted,
when any accident in the troubles of the times threw it off, and
left him to bear alone the burden which belonged to his position in
the state. It seems, indeed, to have been a part of the Constable’s
policy to give up the king to his natural indolence, and encourage
his effeminacy by filling his time with amusements that would make
business more unwelcome to him than the hard tyranny of the minister
who relieved him from it.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579"
class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[p. 353]</span>Among these
amusements, none better suited the humor of the idle king than letters.
He was by no means without talent. He sometimes wrote verses. He kept
the poets of the time much about his person, and more in his confidence
and favor than was wise. He had, perhaps, even a partial perception
of the advantage of intellectual refinement to his country, or at
least to his court. One of his private secretaries, to please his
master and those nearest to the royal influence, made, about the year
1449, an ample collection of the Spanish poetry then most in favor,
comprising the works of about fifty authors.<a id="FNanchor_580"
href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Juan de Mena, the most
distinguished poet of the time, was his official chronicler, and the
king sent him documents and directions, with great minuteness and an
amusing personal vanity, respecting the manner in which the history
of his reign should be written; while Juan de Mena, on his part,
like a true courtier, sent his verses to the king to be corrected.<a
id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> His
physician, too, who seems to have been always in attendance on his
person, was the gay and good-humored Ferdinand Gomez, who has left
us, if we are to believe them genuine, a pleasing and characteristic
collection of letters; and who, after having served and followed his
royal master above forty years, sleeping, as he tells us, at his feet
and eating at his table, mourned his death, as that of one whose
kindness to him had been constant and generous.<a id="FNanchor_582"
href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Surrounded by persons such as these, in continual intercourse
with others like them, and often given up<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span> to letters to avoid the solicitation of
state affairs and to gratify his constitutional indolence, John the
Second made his reign, though discreditable to himself as a prince, and
disastrous to Castile as an independent state, still interesting by a
sort of poetical court which he gathered about him, and important as it
gave an impulse to refinement perceptible afterwards through several
generations.</p>

<p>There has been a period like this in the history of nearly all the
modern European nations,—one in which a taste for poetical composition
was common at court, and among those higher classes of society within
whose limits intellectual cultivation was then much confined. In
Germany, such a period is found as early as the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries; the unhappy young Conradin, who perished in 1268 and is
commemorated by Dante, being one of the last of the princely company
that illustrates it. For Italy, it begins at about the same time, in
the Sicilian court; and though discountenanced both by the spirit of
the Church, and by the spirit of such commercial republics as Pisa,
Genoa, and Florence,—no one of which had then the chivalrous tone that
animated, and indeed gave birth, to this early refinement throughout
Europe,—it can still be traced down as far as the age of Petrarch.</p>

<p>Of the appearance of such a taste in the South of France, in
Catalonia, and in Aragon, with its spread to Castile under the
patronage of Alfonso the Wise, notice has already been taken. But now
we find it in the heart and in the North of the country, extending,
too, into Andalusia and Portugal, full of love and knighthood; and
though not without the conceits that distinguished it wherever it
appeared, yet sometimes showing touches of nature, and still oftener a
graceful ingenuity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span>
of art, that have not lost their interest down to our own times. Under
its influence was formed that school of poetry which, marked by its
most prominent attribute, has been sometimes called the school of the
<i>Minnesingers</i>, or the poets of love and gallantry;<a id="FNanchor_583"
href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> a school which either
owed its existence everywhere to the Troubadours of Provence, or took,
as it advanced, much of their character. In the latter part of the
thirteenth century, its spirit is already perceptible in the Castilian;
and, from that time, we have occasionally caught glimpses of it, down
to the point at which we are now arrived,—the first years of the reign
of John the Second,—when we find it beginning to be colored by an
infusion of the Italian, and spreading out into such importance as to
require a separate examination.</p>

<p>And the first person in the group to whom our notice is attracted,
as its proper, central figure, is King John himself. Of him his
chronicler said, with much truth, though not quite without flattery,
that “he drew all men to him, was very free and gracious, very devout
and very bold, and gave himself much to the reading of philosophy and
poetry. He was skilled in matters of the Church, tolerably learned
in Latin, and a great respecter of such men as had knowledge. He had
many natural gifts. He was a lover of music; he played, sung, and made
verses; and he danced well.”<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584"
class="fnanchor">[584]</a> One who knew him better describes him more
skilfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span> “He
was,” says Fernan Perez de Guzman, “a man who talked with judgment
and discretion. He knew other men, and understood who conversed well,
wisely, and graciously; and he loved to listen to men of sense, and
noted what they said. He spoke and understood Latin. He read well, and
liked books and histories, and loved to hear witty rhymes, and knew
when they were not well made. He took great solace in gay and shrewd
conversation, and could bear his part in it. He loved the chase, and
hunting of fierce animals, and was well skilled in all the arts of it.
Music, too, he understood, and sung and played; was good in jousting,
and bore himself well in tilting with reeds.”<a id="FNanchor_585"
href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>How much poetry he wrote we do not know. His physician says, “The
king recreates himself with writing verses”;<a id="FNanchor_586"
href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> and others repeat the
fact. But the chief proof of his skill that has come down to our times
is to be found in the following lines, in the Provençal manner, on
the falsehood of his lady.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587"

progress of poetry in Spain, and labored most directly to introduce
it at the court of Castile, the person first in rank after the king
was his near kinsman, Henry, Marquis of Villena, born in 1384, and
descended in the paternal line from the royal house of Aragon,
and in the maternal from that of Castile.<a id="FNanchor_588"
href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> “In early youth,”
says one who knew him well, “he was inclined to the sciences and
the arts, rather than to knightly exercises, or even to affairs,
whether of the state or the Church; for, without any master, and none
constraining him to learn, but rather hindered by his grandfather,
who would have had him for a knight, he did, in childhood, when
others are wont to be carried to their schools by force, turn
himself to learning against the good-will of all; and so high and so
subtile a wit had he, that he learned any science or art to which
he addicted himself, in such wise, that it seemed as if it were
done by force of nature.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589"
class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>But his rank and position brought him into the af<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span>fairs of the world and
the troubles of the times, however little he might be fitted to play
a part in them. He was made Master of the great military and monastic
Order of Calatrava, but, owing to irregularities in his election, was
ultimately ejected from his place, and left in a worse condition than
if he had never received it.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590"
class="fnanchor">[590]</a> In the mean time, he resided chiefly at
the court of Castile; but from 1412 to 1414 he was at that of his
kinsman, Ferdinand the Just, of Aragon, in honor of whose coronation
at Saragossa he composed an allegorical drama, which is unhappily
lost. Afterwards, he accompanied that monarch to Barcelona, where, as
we have seen, he did much to restore and sustain the poetical school
called the Consistory of the Gaya Sciencia. When, however, he lost his
place as Master of the Order of Calatrava, he sunk into obscurity. The
Regency of Castile, willing to make him some amends for his losses,
gave him the poor lordship of Iniesta in the bishopric of Cuenca;
and there he spent the last twenty years of his life in comparative
poverty, earnestly devoted to such studies as were known and
fashionable in his time. He died while on a visit at Madrid, in 1434;
the last of his great family.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591"
class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span>Among his
favorite studies, besides poetry, history, and elegant literature,
were philosophy and the mathematics, astrology, and alchemy. But in
an age of great ignorance and superstition, such pursuits were not
indulged in without rebuke. Don Enrique, therefore, like others,
was accounted a necromancer; and so deeply did this belief strike
its roots, that a popular tradition of his guilt has survived in
Spain nearly or quite down to our own age.<a id="FNanchor_592"
href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The effects, at the
time, were yet more unhappy and absurd. A large and rare collection
of books that he left behind him excited alarm, immediately after his
death. “Two cart-loads of them,” says one claimed to have been his
contemporary and friend, “were carried to the king, and because it
was said they related to magic and unlawful arts, the king sent them
to Friar Lope de Barrientos;<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593"
class="fnanchor">[593]</a> and Friar Lope, who cares more to be about
the Prince than to examine matters of necromancy, burnt above a hundred
volumes, of which he saw no more than the king of Morocco did, and
knew no more than the Dean of Ciudad Rodrigo; for many men now-a-days
make themselves the name of learned by calling others ignorant;
but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span> it is worse
yet when men make themselves holy by calling others necromancers.”<a
id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Juan
de Mena, to whom the letter containing this statement was addressed,
offered a not ungraceful tribute to the memory of Villena in three of
his three hundred <i>coplas</i>;<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595"
class="fnanchor">[595]</a> and the Marquis of Santillana, distinguished
for his love of letters, wrote a separate poem on the occasion of his
noble friend’s death, placing him, after the fashion of his age and
country, above all Greek, above all Roman fame.<a id="FNanchor_596"
href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>But though the unhappy Marquis of Villena may have been in advance
of his age, as far as his studies and knowledge were concerned, still
the few of his works now known to us are far from justifying the whole
of the reputation his contemporaries gave him. His “Arte Cisoria,”
or Art of Carving, is proof of this. It was written in 1423, at the
request of his friend, the chief carver of John the Second, and begins,
in the most formal and pedantic manner, with the creation of the world
and the invention of all the arts, among which the art of carving is
made early to assume a high place. Then follows an account of what
is necessary to make a good carver; after which we have, in detail,
the whole mystery of the art, as it ought to be practised at the
royal table. It is obvious from sundry passages of the work, that the
Marquis himself was by no means without a love for the good cheer he
so carefully explains,—a circumstance, perhaps, to which he owed the
gout that we are told severely tormented his latter years. But in its
style and composition this specimen of the didactic prose of the age
has little value, and can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p.
361]</span> really curious only to those who are interested in
the history of manners.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597"
class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>Similar remarks might probably be made about his treatise on
the “Arte de Trobar,” or the “Gaya Sciencia”; a sort of Art of
Poetry, addressed to the Marquis of Santillana, in order to carry
into his native Castile some of the poetical skill possessed by the
Troubadours of the South. But we have only an imperfect abstract of
it, accompanied, indeed, with portions of the original work, which
are interesting as being the oldest on its subject in the language.<a
id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
More interesting, however, than either would be his translations of
the Rhetorica of Cicero, the Divina Commedia of Dante, and the Æneid
of Virgil. But of the first we have lost all trace. Of the second
we know only that it was in prose, and addressed to his friend and
kinsman the Marquis of Santillana. And of the Æneid there remain but
seven books, with a commentary to three of them, from which a few
extracts have been published.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599"
class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Villena’s reputation, therefore, must rest chiefly on<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[p. 362]</span> his “Trabajos de
Hercules,” or The Labors of Hercules, written to please one of his
Catalonian friends, Pero Pardo, who asked to have an explanation of
the virtues and achievements of Hercules; always a great national
hero in Spain. The work seems to have been much admired and read in
manuscript, and, after printing was introduced into Spain, it went
through two editions before the year 1500; but all knowledge of it was
so completely lost soon afterwards, that the most intelligent authors
of Spanish literary history down to our own times have generally spoken
of it as a poem. It is, however, in fact, a short prose treatise,
filling, in the first edition—that of 1483—thirty large leaves. It
is divided into twelve chapters, each devoted to one of the twelve
great labors of Hercules, and each subdivided into four parts: the
first part containing the common mythological story of the labor
under consideration; the second, an explanation of this story as if
it were an allegory; the third, the historical facts upon which it is
conjectured to have been founded; and the fourth, a moral application
of the whole to some one of twelve conditions, into which the author
very arbitrarily divides the human race, beginning with princes and
ending with women.</p>

<p>Thus, in the fourth chapter, after telling the commonly received
tale, or, as he calls it, “the naked story,” of the Garden of the
Hesperides, he gives us an allegory of it, showing that Libya, where
the fair garden is placed, is human nature, dry and sandy; that
Atlas, its lord, is the wise man, who knows how to cultivate his
poor desert; that the garden is the garden of knowledge, divided
according to the sciences; that the tree in the midst is philosophy;
that the dragon watching the tree is the difficulty of study; and
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span> the three
Hesperides are Intelligence, Memory, and Eloquence. All this and
more he explains under the third head, by giving the facts which he
would have us suppose constituted the foundation of the first two;
telling us that King Atlas was a wise king of the olden time, who
first arranged and divided all the sciences; and that Hercules went
to him and acquired them, after which he returned and imparted his
acquisitions to King Eurystheus. And, finally, in the fourth part of
the chapter, he applies it all to the Christian priesthood and the duty
of this priesthood to become learned and explain the Scriptures to the
ignorant laity; as if there were any possible analogy between them
and Hercules and his fables.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600"
class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>The book, however, is worth the trouble of reading. It is, no
doubt, full of the faults peculiar to its age, and abounds in awkward
citations from Virgil, Ovid, Lucan, and other Latin authors, then so
rarely found and so little known in Spain, that they added materially
to the interest and value of the treatise.<a id="FNanchor_601"
href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> But the allegory
is sometimes amusing; the language is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span> almost always good, and occasionally
striking by fine archaisms; and the whole has a dignity about it which
is not without its appropriate power and grace.<a id="FNanchor_602"
href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>From the Marquis of Villena himself, it is natural for us to turn to
one of his followers, known only as “Macias el Enamorado,” or Macias
the Lover; a name which constantly recurs in Spanish literature with a
peculiar meaning, given by the tragical history of the poet who bore
it. He was a Galician gentleman, who served the Marquis of Villena
as one of his esquires, and became enamoured of a maiden attached to
the same princely household with himself. But the lady, though he won
her love, was married, under the authority that controlled both of
them, to a knight of Porcuna. Still Macias in no degree restrained his
passion, but continued to express it to her in his verses, as he had
done before. The husband was naturally offended, and complained to the
Marquis, who, after in vain rebuking his follower, used his full power
as Grand Master of the Order of Calatrava, and cast Macias into prison.
But there he only devoted himself more passionately to the thoughts
of his lady, and, by his persevering love, still more provoked her
husband, who, secretly following him to his prison at Arjonilla, and
watching him one day as he chanced to be singing of his love and his
sufferings, was so stung by jealousy, that he cast a dart through the
gratings of the window, and killed the unfortunate poet with the name
of his lady still trembling on his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span>The sensation
produced by the death of Macias was such as belongs only to an
imaginative age, and to the sympathy felt for one who perished because
he was both a Troubadour and a lover. All men who desired to be thought
cultivated mourned his fate. His few poems in his native Galician—only
one of which, and that of moderate merit, is preserved entire—became
generally known, and were generally admired. His master, the Marquis of
Villena, Rodriguez del Padron, who was his countryman, Juan de Mena,
the great court poet, and the still greater Marquis of Santillana, all
bore testimony, at the time or immediately afterwards, to the general
sorrow. Others followed their example; and the custom of referring
constantly to him and to his melancholy fate was continued in ballads
and popular songs, until, in the poetry of Lope de Vega, Calderon,
and Quevedo, the name of Macias passed into a proverb, and became
synonymous with the highest and tenderest love.<a id="FNanchor_603"

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> after the king and Villena in rank,
and much before them in merit, stands, at the head of the courtiers
and poets of the reign of John the Second, Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza,
Marquis of Santillana; one of the most distinguished members of that
great family which has sometimes claimed the Cid for its founder,<a
id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
and which certainly, with a long succession of honors, reaches
down to our own times.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605"
class="fnanchor">[605]</a> He was born in 1398, but was left an orphan
in early youth; so that, though his father, the Grand Admiral of
Castile, had, at the time of his death, larger possessions than any
other nobleman in the kingdom, the son, when he was old enough to know
their value, found them chiefly wrested from him by the bold barons who
in the most lawless manner then divided among themselves the power and
resources of the crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span>But the young
Mendoza was not of a temper to submit patiently to such wrongs.
At the age of sixteen he already figures in the chronicles of the
time, as one of the dignitaries of state who honored the coronation
of Ferdinand of Aragon;<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606"
class="fnanchor">[606]</a> and at the age of eighteen, we are told,
he boldly reclaimed his possessions, which, partly through the forms
of law and partly by force of arms, he recovered.<a id="FNanchor_607"
href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> From this period we
find him, during the reign of John the Second, busy in the affairs
of the kingdom, both civil and military; always a personage of great
consideration, and apparently one who, in difficult circumstances and
wild times, acted from manly motives. When only thirty years old,
he was distinguished at court as one of the persons concerned in
arranging the marriage of the Infanta of Aragon;<a id="FNanchor_608"
href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> and, soon afterwards,
had a separate command against the Navarrese, in which, though he
suffered a defeat from greatly superior numbers, he acquired lasting
honor by his personal bravery and firmness.<a id="FNanchor_609"
href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Against the Moors
he commanded long, and was often successful; and after the battle
of Olmedo, in 1445, he was raised to the very high rank of Marquis;
none in Castile having preceded him in that title except the family
of Villena, already extinct.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610"
class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>He was early, but not violently, opposed to the great favorite,
the Constable Alvaro de Luna. In 1432, some<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span> of his friends and kinsmen, the good
Count Haro and the Bishop of Palencia, with their adherents, having
been seized by order of the Constable, Mendoza shut himself up in
his strongholds till he was fully assured of his own safety.<a
id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
From this time, therefore, the relations between two such personages
could not be considered friendly; but still appearances were kept up,
and the next year, at a grand jousting before the king in Madrid,
where Mendoza offered himself against all comers, the Constable was
one of his opponents; and after the encounter, they feasted together
merrily and in all honor.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612"
class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Indeed, the troubles between them were
inconsiderable till 1448 and 1449, when the hard proceedings of
the Constable against others of the friends and relations of
Mendoza led him into a more formal opposition,<a id="FNanchor_613"
href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> which in 1452 brought
on a regular conspiracy between himself and two more of the leading
nobles of the kingdom. The next year the favorite was sacrificed.<a
id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> In
the last scenes, however, of this extraordinary tragedy, the Marquis of
Santillana seems to have had little share.</p>

<p>The king, disheartened by the loss of the minister on whose
commanding genius he had so long relied, died in 1454. But Henry
the Fourth, who followed on the throne of Castile, seemed even more
willing to favor the great family of the Mendozas than his father had
been. The Marquis, however, was little disposed to take advantage
of his position. His wife died in 1455, and the pilgrimage he made
on that occasion to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and the
religious poetry he wrote the same year, show the direction his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span> thoughts had now taken.
In this state of mind he seems to have continued; and though he once
afterwards joined effectively with others to urge upon the king’s
notice the disordered and ruinous state of the kingdom, yet, from the
fall of the Constable to the time of his own death, which happened in
1458, the Marquis was chiefly busied with letters, and with such other
occupations and thoughts as were consistent with a retired life.<a
id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>It is remarkable, that one, who, from his birth and position, was so
much involved in the affairs of state at a period of great confusion
and violence, should yet have cultivated elegant literature with
earnestness. But the Marquis of Santillana, as he wrote to a friend and
repeated to Prince Henry, believed that knowledge neither blunts the
point of the lance, nor weakens the arm that wields a knightly sword.<a
id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
He therefore gave himself freely to poetry and other graceful
accomplishments; encouraged, perhaps, by the thought, that he was
thus on the road to please the wayward monarch he served, if not the
stern favorite who governed them all. One who was bred at the court,
of which the Marquis was so distinguished an ornament, says, “He had
great store of books, and gave himself to study, especially the study
of moral philosophy and of things foreign and old. And he had always
in his house doctors and masters, with whom he discoursed concerning
the knowledge and the books he studied. Likewise, he himself made<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p. 370]</span> other books in verse and
in prose, profitable to provoke to virtue and to restrain from vice.
And in such wise did he pass the greater part of his leisure. Much
fame and renown, also, he had in many kingdoms out of Spain; but he
thought it a greater matter to have esteem among the wise than name
and fame with the many.”<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617"
class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>The works of the Marquis of Santillana show, with sufficient
distinctness, the relations in which he stood to his times and the
direction he was disposed to take. From his social position, he could
easily gratify any reasonable literary curiosity or taste he might
possess; for the resources of the kingdom were open to him, and he
could, therefore, not only obtain for his private study the poetry
then abroad in the world, but often command to his presence the poets
themselves. He was born in the Asturias, where his great family fiefs
lay, and was educated in Castile; so that, on this side, he belonged
to the genuinely indigenous school of Spanish poetry. But then he was
also intimate with the Marquis of Villena, the head of the poetical
Consistory of Barcelona, who, to encourage his poetical studies,
addressed to him, in 1433, his curious letter on the art of the
Troubadours, which Villena thus proposed to introduce into Castile.<a
id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> And,
after all, he lived chiefly at the court of John the Second, and was
the friend and patron of the poets there, through whom and through his
love of foreign letters it was natural he should come in contact with
the great Italian masters, now exercising a wide sway within their own
peninsula. We must not be surprised, therefore, to find that his own
works belong more or less to each of these schools, and define his
position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> as that of
one who stands connected with the Provençal literature in Spain, which
we have just examined; with the Italian, whose influences were now
beginning to appear; and with the genuinely Spanish, which, though it
often bears traces of each of the others, prevails at last over both of
them.</p>

<p>Of his familiarity with the Provençal poetry abundant proof may
be found in the Preface to his Proverbs, which he wrote when young,
and in his letter to the Constable of Portugal, which belongs to the
latter period of his life. In both, he treats the rules of that poetry
as well founded, explaining them much as his friend and kinsman,
the Marquis of Villena, did; and of some of the principal of its
votaries in Spain, such as Bergédan, and Pedro and Ausias March, he
speaks with great respect.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619"
class="fnanchor">[619]</a> To Jordi, his contemporary, he elsewhere
devotes an allegorical poem of some length and merit, intended
to do him the highest honor as a Troubadour.<a id="FNanchor_620"
href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>But besides this, he directly imitated the Provençal poets. By far
the most beautiful of his works, and one which may well be compared
with the most graceful of the smaller poems in the Spanish language,
is entirely in the Provençal manner. It is called “Una Serranilla,” or
A Little Mountain Song, and was composed on a little girl, whom, when
following his military duty, he found tending her father’s herds on the
hills. Many such short songs occur in the later Provençal poets, under
the name of “Pastoretas,” and “Vaqueiras,” one of which, by Giraud
Riquier,—the same person who wrote verses on the death of Alfonso the
Wise,—might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span> have
served as the very prototype of the present one; so strong is the
resemblance between them. But none of them, either in the Provençal or
in the Spanish, has ever equalled this “Serranilla” of the soldier;
which, besides its inherent simplicity and liquid sweetness, has such
grace and lightness in its movement, that it bears no marks of an
unbecoming imitation, but, on the contrary, is rather to be regarded as
a model of the natural old Castilian song, never to be transferred to
another language, and hardly to be imitated with success in its own.<a
id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>The traces of Italian culture in the poetry of the Marquis of
Santillana are no less obvious and important. Besides praising Dante,
Petrarch, and Boccaccio,<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622"
class="fnanchor">[622]</a> he imitates the opening of the
“Inferno” in a long poem, in octave stanzas, on the death of the
Marquis of Villena;<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623"
class="fnanchor">[623]</a> while, in the “Coronation of Jordi,” he
shows that he was sensible to the power of more than one passage
in the “Purgatorio.”<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624"
class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Moreover, he has the merit—if it be one—of
introducing the peculiarly Italian form of the Sonnet into Spain; and
with the differ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span>ent
specimens of it that still remain among his works begins the ample
series which, since the time of Boscan, has won for itself so large
a space in Spanish literature. Seventeen sonnets of the Marquis of
Santillana have been published, which he himself declares to be written
in “the Italian fashion,” and appeals to Cavalcante, Guido d’Ascoli,
Dante, and especially Petrarch, as his predecessors and models; an
appeal hardly necessary to one who has read them, so plain is his
desire to imitate the greatest of his masters. The sonnets of the
Marquis of Santillana, however, have little merit, except in their
careful versification, and were soon forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_625"
href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>But his principal works were more in the manner then prevalent
at the Spanish court. Most of them are in verse, and, like a short
poem to the queen, several riddles, and a few religious compositions,
are generally full of conceits and affectation, and have little
value of any sort.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626"
class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Two or three, however, are of consequence.
One called “The Complaint of Love,” and referring apparently to
the story of Macias, is written with fluency and sweetness, and is
curious as containing lines in Galician, which, with other similar
verses and his letter to the Constable of Portugal, show he extended
his thoughts to this ancient dialect, where are found some of the
earliest intimations of Spanish literature.<a id="FNanchor_627"
href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Another of his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span> poems, which has been
called “The Ages of the World,” is a compendium of universal history,
beginning at the creation and coming down to the time of John the
Second, with a gross compliment to whom it ends. It was written
in 1426, and fills three hundred and thirty-two stanzas of double
<i>redondillas</i>, dull and prosaic throughout.<a id="FNanchor_628"
href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> The third is a moral
poem, thrown into the shape of a dialogue between Bias and Fortune,
setting forth the Stoical doctrine of the worthlessness of all outward
good. It consists of a hundred and eighty octave stanzas in the short
Spanish measure, and was written for the consolation of a cousin and
much loved friend of the Toledo family, whose imprisonment in 1448,
by order of the Constable, caused great troubles in the kingdom, and
contributed to the final alienation of the Marquis from the favorite.<a
id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>
The fourth is on the kindred subject of the fall and death of the
Constable himself, in 1453; a poem in fifty-three octave stanzas,
each of two <i>redondillas</i>, containing a confession supposed to have
been made by the victim on the scaffold, partly to the multitude
and partly to his priest.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630"
class="fnanchor">[630]</a> In both of the last two poems, and
especially in the dialogue between Bias and Fortune, passages of merit
are found, which are not only fluent, but strong; not only terse
and pointed, but graceful.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631"
class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p. 375]</span>But the most
important of the poetical works of the Marquis of Santillana is one
approaching the form of a drama, and called the “Comedieta de Ponza,”
or The Little Comedy of Ponza. It is founded on the story of a great
sea-fight near the island of Ponza in 1435, where the kings of Aragon
and Navarre, and the Infante Don Henry of Castile, with many noblemen
and knights, were taken prisoners by the Genoese,—a disaster to
Spain, which fills a large space in the old national chronicles.<a
id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> The
poem of Santillana, written immediately after the occurrence of the
calamity it commemorates, is called a Comedy, because its conclusion
is happy, and Dante is cited as authority for this use of the word.<a
id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> But
in fact it is a dream or vision; and one of the early passages in
the “Inferno,” imitated at the very opening, leaves no doubt as to
what was in the author’s mind when he wrote it.<a id="FNanchor_634"
href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> The queens of Navarre
and Aragon, and the Infante Doña Catalina, as the persons most
interested in the unhappy battle, are the chief speakers. But Boccaccio
is also a principal personage, though seemingly for no better reason
than that he wrote the treatise on the Disasters of Princes; and
after being addressed very solemnly in this capacity by the three
royal ladies and by the Marquis of Santillana himself, he answers no
less solemnly in his native Italian. Queen Leonora then gives him an
account of the glories and grandeur of her house, accompanied with
auguries of misfortune, which are hardly uttered before a letter comes
announcing their fulfilment in the calamities of the battle of Ponza.
The queen mother, after hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[p.
376]</span> the contents of this letter quite through, falls as one
dead. Fortune, in a female form, richly attired, enters, and consoles
them all; first showing a magnificent perspective of past times, with
promises of still greater glory to their descendants, and then fairly
presenting to them in person the very princes whose captivity had just
filled them with such fear and grief. And this ends the Comedieta.</p>

<p>It fills a hundred and twenty of the old Italian octave
stanzas,—such stanzas as are used in the “Filostrato” of Boccaccio,—and
much of it is written in easy verse. There is a great deal of ancient
learning introduced into it awkwardly and in bad taste; but there is
one passage in which a description of Fortune is skilfully borrowed
from the seventh canto of the “Inferno,” and another in which is a
pleasing paraphrase of the <i>Beatus ille</i> of Horace.<a id="FNanchor_635"
href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The machinery and
management of the story, it is obvious, could hardly be worse; and yet
when it was written, and perhaps still more when it was declaimed,
as it probably was before some of the sufferers in the disaster it
records, it may well have been felt as an effective exhibition of a
very grave passage in the history of the time. On this account, too, it
is still interesting.</p>

<p>The Comedieta, however, was not the most popular, if it was the
most important, of the works of Santillana. That distinction belongs
to a collection of Proverbs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[p.
377]</span> which he made at the request of John the Second, for the
education of his son Henry, afterwards Henry the Fourth. It consists of
a hundred rhymed sentences, each generally containing one proverb, and
so sometimes passes under the name of the “Centiloquio.” The proverbs
themselves are, no doubt, mostly taken from that unwritten wisdom of
the common people, for which, in this form, Spain has always been more
famous than any other country; but, in the general tone he has adopted,
and in many of his separate instructions, the Marquis is rather
indebted to King Solomon and the New Testament. Such as they are,
however, they had—perhaps from their connection with the service of
the heir-apparent—a remarkable success, to which many old manuscripts,
still extant, bear witness. They were printed, too, as early as 1496;
and in the course of the next century nine or ten editions of them
may be reckoned, generally encumbered with a learned commentary by
Doctor Pedro Diaz of Toledo. They have, however, no poetical value, and
interest us only from the circumstances attending their composition,
and from the fact that they form the oldest collection of proverbs
made in modern times.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636"
class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p. 378]</span>In the
latter part of his life, the fame of the Marquis of Santillana was
spread very widely. Juan de Mena says, that men came from foreign
countries merely to see him;<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637"
class="fnanchor">[637]</a> and the young Constable of Portugal—the same
prince who afterwards entered into the Catalonian troubles, and claimed
to be king of Aragon—formally asked him for his poems, which the
Marquis sent with a letter on the poetic art, by way of introduction,
written about 1455, and containing notices of such Spanish poets as
were his predecessors or contemporaries; a letter which is, in fact,
the most important single document we now possess touching the early
literature of Spain. It is one, too, which contrasts favorably with
the curious epistle he himself received on a similar subject, twenty
years before, from the Marquis of Villena, and shows how much he was in
advance of his age in the spirit of criticism and in a well-considered
love of letters.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638"
class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, in all respects we can see that he was a remarkable man; one
thoroughly connected with his age and strong in its spirit. His conduct
in affairs, from his youth upwards, shows this. So does the tone of his
Proverbs, that of his letter to his imprisoned cousin, and that of his
poem on the death of Alvaro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p.
379]</span> de Luna. He was a poet also, though not of a high order;
a man of much reading, when reading was rare;<a id="FNanchor_639"
href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> and a critic, who
showed judgment, when judgment and the art of criticism hardly went
together. And, finally, he was the founder of an Italian and courtly
school in Spanish poetry; one, on the whole, adverse to the national
spirit, and finally overcome by it, and yet one that long exercised a
considerable sway, and at last contributed something to the materials
which, in the sixteenth century, went to build up and constitute the
proper literature of the country.</p>

<p>There lived, however, during the reign of John the Second, and in
the midst of his court, another poet, whose general influence at the
time was less felt than that of his patron, the Marquis of Santillana,
but who has since been oftener mentioned and remembered,—Juan de Mena,
sometimes, but inappropriately, called the Ennius of Spanish poetry.
He was born in Córdova, about the year 1411, the child of parents
respected, but not noble.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640"
class="fnanchor">[640]</a> He was early left an orphan, and from the
age of three-and-twenty, of his own free choice, devoted himself
wholly to letters; going through a regular course of studies, first
at Salamanca, and afterwards at Rome. On his return home, he became
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span> <i>Veinte-quatro</i>
of Córdova, or one of the twenty-four persons who constituted the
government of the city; but we early find him at court on a footing
of familiarity as a poet, and we know he was soon afterwards Latin
secretary to John the Second, and historiographer of Castile.<a
id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
This brought him into relations with the king and the Constable;
relations important in themselves, and of which we have by accident
a few singular intimations. The king, if we can trust the witness,
was desirous to be well regarded in history; and, to make sure of it,
directed his confidential physician to instruct his historiographer,
from time to time, how he ought to treat different parts of his
subject. In one letter, for instance, he is told with much gravity,
“The king is very desirous of praise”; and then follows a statement of
facts, as they ought to be represented, in a somewhat delicate case
of the neglect of the Count de Castro to obey the royal commands.<a
id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
In another letter he is told, “The king expects much glory from
you”; a remark which is followed by another narrative of facts as
they should be set forth.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643"
class="fnanchor">[643]</a> But though Juan de Mena was employed on this
important work as late as 1445, and apparently was favored in it, both
by the king and the Constable, still there is no reason to suppose
that any part of what he did is preserved in the Chronicle of John the
Second exactly as it came from his hands.</p>

<p>The chronicler, however, who seems to have been happy in possessing
a temperament proper for courtly success, has left proofs enough of
the means by which he reached it. He was a sort of poet-laureate
without the title, writing verses on the battle of Olmedo in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span> 1445, on the pacification
between the king and his son in 1446, on the affair of Peñafiel in
1449, and on the slight wound the Constable received at Palencia in
1452; in all which, as well as in other and larger poems, he shows a
great devotion to the reigning powers of the state.<a id="FNanchor_644"
href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>He stood well, too, in Portugal. The Infante Don Pedro—a
verse-writer of some name, who travelled much in different parts of
the world—became personally acquainted with Juan de Mena in Spain,
and, on his return to Lisbon, addressed a few verses to him, better
than the answer they called forth; besides which, he imitated, with
no mean skill, Mena’s “Labyrinth,” in a Spanish poem of a hundred
and twenty-five stanzas.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645"
class="fnanchor">[645]</a> With such connections and habits,
with a wit that made him agreeable in personal intercourse,<a
id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> and
with an even good-humor which rendered him welcome to the opposite
parties in the kingdom,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647"
class="fnanchor">[647]</a> he seems to have led a contented life; and
at his death, which happened suddenly in 1456, in consequence of a
fall from his mule, the Marquis of Santillana, always his friend and
patron, wrote his epitaph, and erected a monument to his memory in
Torrelaguna, both of which are still to be seen.<a id="FNanchor_648"
href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span>The works of
Juan de Mena evidently enjoyed the sunshine of courtly favor from their
first appearance. While still young, if we can trust the simple-hearted
letters that pass under the name of the royal physician, they were
already the subject of gossip at the palace;<a id="FNanchor_649"
href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> and the collections of
poetry made by Baena and Estuñiga, for the amusement of the king and
the court, about 1450, contain abundant proofs that his favor was not
worn out by time; for as many of his verses as could be found seem to
have been put into each of them. But though this circumstance, and that
of their appearance before the end of the century in two or three of
the very earliest printed collections of poetry, leave no doubt that
they enjoyed, from the first, a sort of fashionable success, still
it can hardly be said they were at any time really popular. Two or
three of his shorter effusions, indeed, like the verses addressed to
his lady to show her how formidable she is in every way, and those on
a vicious mule he had bought from a friar, have a spirit that would
make them amusing anywhere.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650"
class="fnanchor">[650]</a> But most of his minor poems, of which about
twenty may be found scattered in rare books,<a id="FNanchor_651"
href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> belong only to
the fashionable style of the society in which he lived, and, from
their affectation, conceits, and obscure allusions, can have had
little value, even when they were first circulated, except to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span> the persons to whom they
were addressed, or the narrow circle in which those persons moved.</p>

<p>His poem on the Seven Deadly Sins, in nearly eight hundred
short verses, divided into double <i>redondillas</i>, is a work of
graver pretensions. But it is a dull allegory, full of pedantry and
metaphysical fancies on the subject of a war between Reason and
the Will of Man. Notwithstanding its length, however, it was left
unfinished; and a certain friar, named Gerónimo de Olivares, added four
hundred more verses to it, in order to bring the discussion to what he
conceived a suitable conclusion. Both parts, however, are as tedious as
the theology of the age could make them.</p>

<p>His “Coronation” is better, and fills about five hundred lines,
arranged in double <i>quintillas</i>. Its name comes from its subject, which
is an imaginary journey of Juan de Mena to Mount Parnassus, in order
to witness the coronation of the Marquis of Santillana, both as a poet
and a hero, by the Muses and the Virtues. It is, therefore, strictly
a poem in honor of his great patron; and being such, it is somewhat
singular that it should be written in a light and almost satirical
vein. At the opening, as well as in other parts, it has the appearance
of a parody on the “Divina Commedia”; for it begins with the wanderings
of the author in an obscure wood, after which he passes through regions
of misery, where he beholds the punishments of the dead; visits the
abodes of the blessed, where he sees the great of former ages; and,
at last, comes to Mount Parnassus, where he is present at a sort of
apotheosis of the yet living object of his reverence and admiration.
The versification of the poem is easy, and some passages in it are
amusing; but, in general, it is rendered dull by unprofitable learning.
The best portions are those merely descriptive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span>But whether
Juan de Mena, in his “Coronation,” intended deliberately to be the
parodist of Dante or not, it is quite plain that in his principal work,
called “The Labyrinth,” he became Dante’s serious imitator. This long
poem—which he seems to have begun very early, and which, though he
occupied himself much with its composition, he left unfinished at the
time of his sudden death—consists of about twenty-five hundred lines,
divided into stanzas; each stanza being composed of two <i>redondillas</i>
in those long lines which were then called “versos de arte mayor,” or
verses of higher art, because they were supposed to demand a greater
degree of skill than the shorter verses used in the old national
measures. The poem itself is sometimes called “The Labyrinth,” probably
from the intricacy of its plan, and sometimes “The Three Hundred,”
because that was originally the number of its <i>coplas</i> or stanzas. Its
purpose is nothing less than to teach, by vision and allegory, whatever
relates to the duties or the destiny of man; and the rules by which its
author was governed in its composition are evidently gathered from the
example of Dante in his “Divina Commedia,” and from Dante’s precepts in
his treatise “De Vulgari Eloquentia.”</p>

<p>After the dedication of the Labyrinth to John the Second, and some
other preparatory and formal parts, the poem opens with the author’s
wanderings in a wood, like Dante, exposed to beasts of prey. While
there, he is met by Providence, who comes to him in the form of a
beautiful woman, and offers to lead him, by a sure path, through the
dangers that beset him, and to explain, “as far as they are palpable
to human understanding,” the dark mysteries of life that oppress
his spirit. This promise she fulfils by carrying him to what she
calls the spherical centre of the five zones; or, in other<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span> words, to a point where
the poet is supposed to see at once all the countries and nations of
the earth. There she shows him three vast mystical wheels,—the wheels
of Destiny,—two representing the past and the future, in constant
rest, and the third representing the present, in constant motion.
Each contains its appropriate portion of the human race, and through
each are extended the seven circles of the seven planetary influences
that govern the fates of mortal men; the characters of the most
distinguished of whom are explained to the poet by his divine guide, as
their shadows rise before him in these mysterious circles.</p>

<p>From this point, therefore, the poem becomes a confused gallery
of mythological and historical portraits, arranged, as in the
“Paradiso” of Dante, according to the order of the seven planets.<a
id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
They have generally little merit, and are often shadowed forth very
indistinctly. The best sketches are those of personages who lived in
the poet’s own time or country; some drawn with courtly flattery, like
the king’s and the Constable’s; others with more truth, as well as
more skill, like those of the Marquis of Villena, Juan de Merlo, and
the young Dávalos, whose premature fate is recorded in a few lines of
unwonted power and tenderness.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653"
class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span>The story
told most in detail is that of the Count de Niebla, who, in 1436,
at the siege of Gibraltar, sacrificed his own life in a noble
attempt to save that of one of his dependants; the boat in which
the Count might have been rescued being too small to save the whole
of the party, who thus all perished together in a flood-tide. This
disastrous event, and especially the self-devotion of Niebla, who
was one of the principal nobles of the kingdom, and at that moment
employed on a daring expedition against the Moors, are recorded in the
chronicles of the age, and introduced by Juan de Mena in the following
characteristic stanzas:<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654"
class="fnanchor">[654]</a>—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And he who seems to sit upon that bark,</p>
<p class="i2">Invested by the cruel waves, that wait</p>
<p class="i2">And welter round him to prepare his fate,—</p>
<p class="i0">His and his bold companions’, in their dark</p>
<p class="i0">And watery abyss;—that stately form</p>
<p class="i2">Is Count Niebla’s, he whose honored name,</p>
<p class="i2">More brave than fortunate, has given to fame</p>
<p class="i0">The very tide that drank his life-blood warm.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">And they that eagerly around him press,</p>
<p class="i2">Though men of noble mark and bold emprise,</p>
<p class="i2">Grow pale and dim as his full glories rise,</p>
<p class="i0">Showing their own peculiar honors less.</p>
<p class="i0">Thus Carrion or Arlanza, sole and free,</p>
<p class="i2">Bears, like Pisuerga, each its several name,</p>
<p class="i2">And triumphs in its undivided fame,</p>
<p class="i0">As a fair, graceful stream. But when the three</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">Are joined in one, each yields its separate right,</p>
<p class="i2">And their accumulated headlong course</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span>We call Duero. Thus might these enforce</p>
<p class="i0">Each his own claim to stand the noblest knight,</p>
<p class="i2">If brave Niebla came not with his blaze</p>
<p class="i2">Of glory to eclipse their humbler praise.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Too much honor is not to be claimed for such poetry; but there is
little in Juan de Mena’s works equal to this specimen, which has at
least the merit of being free from the pedantry and conceits that
disfigure most of his writings.</p>

<p>Such as it was, however, the Labyrinth received great admiration
from the court of John the Second, and, above all, from the king
himself, whose physician, we are told, wrote to the poet: “Your
polished and erudite work, called ‘The Second Order of Mercury,’ hath
much pleased his Majesty, who carries it with him when he journeys
about or goes a-hunting.”<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655"
class="fnanchor">[655]</a> And again: “The end of the ‘third circle’
pleased the king much. I read it to his Majesty, who keeps it on his
table with his prayer-book, and takes it up often.”<a id="FNanchor_656"
href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> Indeed, the whole
poem was, it seems, submitted to the king, piece by piece, as it was
composed; and we are told, that, in one instance, at least, it received
a royal correction, which still stands unaltered.<a id="FNanchor_657"
href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> His Majesty even
advised that it should be extended from three hundred stanzas to three
hundred and sixty-five, though for no better reason than to make their
number correspond exactly with that of the days in the year; and the
twenty-four stanzas commonly printed at the end of it are supposed to
have been an attempt to fulfil the monarch’s command. But whether this
be so or not, nobody now wishes the poem to be longer than it is.<a

  Castilian Language. — Poets of the Time of John the Second.
  — Villasandino. — Francisco Imperial. — Baena. — Rodriguez
  del Padron. — Prose-writers. — Cibdareal and Fernan Perez de
  Guzman.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one point of view, all the works
of Juan de Mena are of consequence. They mark the progress of the
Castilian language, which, in his hands, advanced more than it had
for a long period before. From the time of Alfonso the Wise, nearly
two centuries had elapsed, in which, though this fortunate dialect
had almost completely asserted its supremacy over its rivals, and by
the force of political circumstances had been spread through a large
part of Spain, still, little had been done to enrich and nothing to
raise or purify it. The grave and stately tone of the “Partidas” and
the “General Chronicle” had not again been reached; the lighter air
of the “Conde Lucanor” had not been attempted. Indeed, such wild and
troubled times, as those of Peter the Cruel and the three monarchs who
had followed him on the throne, permitted men to think of little except
their personal safety and their immediate well-being.</p>

<p>But now, in the time of John the Second, though the affairs of the
country were hardly more composed, they had taken the character rather
of feuds between the great nobles than of wars with the throne; while,
at the same time, knowledge and literary culture, from acci<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[p. 390]</span>dental circumstances,
were not only held in honor, but had become a courtly fashion. Style,
therefore, began to be regarded as a matter of consequence, and the
choice of words, as the first step towards elevating and improving it,
was attempted by those who wished to enjoy the favor of the highest
class, that then gave its tone alike to letters and to manners. But
a serious obstacle was at once found to such a choice of phraseology
as was demanded. The language of Castile had, from the first, been
dignified and picturesque, but it had never been rich. Juan de Mena,
therefore, looked round to see how he could enlarge his poetical
vocabulary; and if he had adopted means more discreet, or shown more
judgment in the use of those to which he resorted, he might almost have
modelled the Spanish into such forms as he chose.</p>

<p>As it was, he rendered it good service. He took boldly such words
as he thought suitable to his purpose, wherever he found them, chiefly
from the Latin, but sometimes from other languages.<a id="FNanchor_659"
href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> Unhappily, he exercised
no proper skill in the selection. Some of the many he adopted were low
and trivial, and his example<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p.
391]</span> failed to give them dignity; others were not better than
those for which they were substituted, and so were not afterwards used;
and yet others were quite too foreign in their structure and sound
to strike root where they should never have been transplanted. Much,
therefore, of what Juan de Mena did in this respect was unsuccessful.
But there is no doubt that the language of Spanish poetry was
strengthened and its versification ennobled by his efforts, and that
the example he set, followed, as it was, by Lucena, Diego de San Pedro,
Garci Sanchez de Badajoz, the Manriques, and others, laid the true
foundations for the greater and more judicious enlargement of the whole
Castilian vocabulary in the age that followed.</p>

<p>Another poet, who, in the reign of John the Second, enjoyed a
reputation which has faded away much more than that of Juan de Mena,
is Alfonso Alvarez de Villasandino, sometimes called De Illescas. His
earliest verses seem to have been written in the time of John the
First; but the greater part fall within the reigns of Henry the Third
and John the Second, and especially within that of the last. A few of
them are addressed to this monarch, and many more to his queen, to the
Constable, to the Infante Don Ferdinand, afterwards king of Aragon, and
to other distinguished personages of the time. From different parts of
them, we learn that their author was a soldier and a courtier; that he
was married twice, and repented heartily of his second match; and that
he was generally poor, and often sent bold solicitations to every body,
from the king downwards, asking for places, for money, and even for
clothes.</p>

<p>As a poet, his merits are small. He speaks of Dante, but
gives no proof of familiarity with Italian<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_392">[p. 392]</span> literature. In fact, his verses
are rather in the Provençal forms, though their courtly tone and
personal claims predominate to such a degree as to prevent any thing
else from being distinctly heard. Puns, conceits, and quibbles, to
please the taste of his great friends, are intruded everywhere; yet
perhaps he gained his chief favor by his versification, which is
sometimes uncommonly easy and flowing, and by his rhymes, which are
singularly abundant and almost uniformly exact.<a id="FNanchor_660"
href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>At any rate, he was much regarded by his contemporaries. The
Marquis of Santillana speaks of him as one of the leading poets of
his age, and says that he wrote a great number of songs and other
short poems, or <i>decires</i>, which were well liked and widely spread.<a
id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> It is
not remarkable, therefore, when Baena, for the amusement of John the
Second and his court, made the collection of poetry which now passes
under his name, that he filled much of it with verses by Villasandino,
who is declared by the courtly secretary to be “the light, and mirror,
and crown, and monarch of all the poets that, till that time, had
lived in Spain.” But the poems Baena admired are almost all of them
so short and so personal, that they were soon forgotten, with the
circumstances that gave them birth. Several are curious, because they
were written to be used, by persons of distinction in the state,
such as the Adelantado Manrique, the Count de Buelna, and the Great
Constable, all of whom were among Villasandino’s admirers, and employed
him to write verses which passed afterwards un<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span>der their own names. Of one short poem,
a Hymn to the Madonna, the author himself thought so well, that he
often said it would surely clear him, in the other world, from the
power of the Arch-enemy.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662"
class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>Francisco Imperial, born in Genoa, but in fact a Spaniard, whose
home was at Seville, is also among the poets who were favored at
this period, and who belonged to the same artificial school with
Villasandino. The principal of his longer poems is on the birth of
King John, in 1405, and most of the others are on subjects connected,
like this, with transient interests. One, however, from its tone and
singular subject, is still curious. It is on the fate of a lady,
who, having been taken among the spoils of a great victory in the
far East, by Tamerlane, was sent by him as a present to Henry the
Third of Castile; and it must be admitted that the Genoese touches
the peculiar misfortune of her condition with poetical tenderness.<a
id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>Of the remaining poets who were more or less valued in Spain, in
the middle of the fifteenth century, it is not necessary to speak at
all. Most of them are now known only to antiquarian curiosity. Of by
far the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span> greater
part very little remains; and in most cases it is uncertain whether
the persons whose names the poems bear were their real authors or
not. Juan Alfonso de Baena, the editor of the collection in which
most of them are found, wrote a good deal,<a id="FNanchor_664"
href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> and so did
Ferrant Manuel de Lando,<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665"
class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Juan Rodriguez del Padron,<a
id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
Pedro Velez de Guevara, and Gerena and Calavera.<a id="FNanchor_667"
href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Probably, however,
nothing remains of the inferior authors more interesting than a
Vision composed by Diego de Castillo, the chronicler, on the death of
Alfonso the Fifth of Aragon,<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668"
class="fnanchor">[668]</a> and a sketch of the life and character
of Henry the Third of Castile, given in the person of the monarch
himself, by Pero Ferrus;<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669"
class="fnanchor">[669]</a>—poems which remind us strongly of the
similar sketches found in the old English “Mirror for Magistrates.”</p>


<p class="mt2">But while verse was so much cultivated, prose, though
less regarded and not coming properly into the fashionable literature
of the age, made some progress. We turn, therefore, now to two
writers who flourished in the reign of John the Second, and who seem
to furnish, with the contemporary chronicles and other similar works
already noticed, the true character of the better prose literature of
their time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span>The first of them
is Fernan Gomez de Cibdareal, who, if there ever were such a person,
was the king’s physician, and, in some respects, his confidential
and familiar friend. He was born, according to the Letters that pass
under his name, about 1386,<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670"
class="fnanchor">[670]</a> and, though not of a distinguished family,
had for his godfather Pedro Lopez de Ayala, the great chronicler and
chancellor of Castile. When he was not yet four-and-twenty years old,
John the Second being still a child, Cibdareal entered the royal
service and remained attached to the king’s person till the death of
his master, when we lose sight of him altogether. During this long
period of above forty years, he maintained a correspondence, to which
we have already alluded more than once, with many of the principal
persons in the state; with the king himself, with several of the
archbishops and bishops, and with a considerable number of noblemen and
men of letters, among the last of whom were Alfonso de Cartagena and
Juan de Mena. A part of this correspondence, amounting to one hundred
and five letters, written between 1425 and 1454, has been published, in
two editions; the first claiming to be of 1499, and the last prepared
in 1775, with some care, by Amirola, the Secretary of the Spanish
Academy of History. Most of the subjects discussed by the honest
physician and courtier in these letters are still interesting; and some
of them, like the death of the Constable, which he describes minutely
to the Archbishop of Toledo, are important, if they can be trusted as
genuine. In almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p. 396]</span>
all he wrote, he shows the good-nature and good sense which preserved
for him the favor of leading persons in the opposite factions of the
time, and which, though he belonged to the party of the Constable, yet
prevented him from being blind to that great man’s faults, or becoming
involved in his fate. The tone of the correspondence is simple and
natural, always quite Castilian, and sometimes very amusing; as, for
instance, when he is repeating court gossip to the Grand Justiciary of
Castile, or telling stories to Juan de Mena. But a very interesting
letter to the Bishop of Orense, containing an account of John the
Second’s death, will perhaps give a better idea of its author’s general
spirit and manner, and, at the same time, exhibit somewhat of his
personal character.</p>

<p>“I foresee very plainly,” he says to the Bishop, “that you will read
with tears this letter, which I write to you in anguish. We are both
become orphans; and so has all Spain. For the good and noble and just
King John, our sovereign lord, is dead. And I, miserable man that I
am,—who was not yet twenty-four years old when I entered his service
with the Bachelor Arrevalo, and have, till I am now sixty-eight, lived
in his palace, or, I might almost say, in his bed-chamber and next his
bed, always in his confidence, and yet never thinking of myself,—I
should now have but a poor pension of thirty thousand maravedís for my
long service, if, just at his death, he had not ordered the government
of Cibdareal to be given to my son, who I pray may be happier than his
father has been. But, in truth, I had always thought to die before his
Highness; whereas he died in my presence, on the eve of Saint Mary
Magdalen, a blessed saint, whom he greatly resembled in sorrowing
over his sins. It was a sharp fever that destroyed him. He was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[p. 397]</span> much wearied with
travelling about hither and thither; and he had always the death of Don
Alvaro de Luna before him, grieving about it secretly, and seeing that
the nobles were never the more quiet for it, but, on the contrary, that
the king of Navarre had persuaded the king of Portugal to think he had
grounds of complaint concerning the wars in Barbary, and that the king
had answered him with a crafty letter. All this wore his heart out.
And so, travelling along from Avila to Medina, a paroxysm came upon
him with a sharp fever, that seemed at first as if it would kill him
straightway. And the Prior of Guadalupe sent directly for Prince Henry;
for he was afraid some of the nobles would gather for the Infante Don
Alfonso; but it pleased God that the king recovered his faculties by
means of a medicine I gave him. And so he went on to Valladolid; but
as soon as he entered the city, he was struck with death, as I said
before the Bachelor Frias, who held it to be a small matter, and before
the Bachelor Beteta, who held what I said to be an idle tale.... The
consolation that remains to me is, that he died like a Christian king,
faithful and loyal to his Maker. Three hours before he gave up the
ghost, he said to me: ‘Bachelor Cibdareal, I ought to have been born
the son of a tradesman, and then I should have been a friar of Abrojo,
and not a king of Castile.’ And then he asked pardon of all about him,
if he had done them any wrong; and bade me ask it for him of those of
whom he could not ask it himself. I followed him to his grave in Saint
Paul’s, and then came to this lonely room in the suburbs; for I am now
so weary of life, that I do not think it will be a difficult matter
to loosen me from it, much as men commonly fear death. Two days ago,
I went to see the queen; but I found the palace from the top to the
bottom so empty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span>
that the house of the Admiral and that of Count Benevente are better
served. King Henry keeps all King John’s servants; but I am too old to
begin to follow another master about, and, if God so pleases, I shall
go to Cibdareal with my son, where I hope the king will give me enough
to die upon.” This is the last we hear of the sorrowing old man, who
probably died soon after the date of this letter, which seems to have
been written in July, 1454.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671"
class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>The other person who was most successful as a prose-writer in
the age of John the Second was Fernan Perez de Guzman,—like many
distinguished Spaniards, a soldier and a man of letters, belonging to
the high aristocracy of the country, and occupied in its affairs. His
mother was sister to the great Chancellor Ayala, and his father was
a brother of the Marquis of Santillana, so that his connections were
as proud and noble as the monarchy could afford; while, on the other
hand, Garcilasso de la Vega being one of his lineal descendants, we may
add that his honors were reflected back from succeeding generations as
brightly as he received them.</p>

<p>He was born about the year 1400, and was bred a knight. At the
battle of the Higueruela, near Granada, in 1431, led on by the Bishop
of Palencia,—who, as the honest Cibdareal says, “fought that day
like an armed Joshua,”—he was so unwise in his courage, that, after
the fight was over, the king, who had been an eyewitness of his
indiscretion, caused him to be put under arrest, and released him only
at the intercession of one of his powerful friends.<a id="FNanchor_672"
href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> In general, Perez
de Guzman was among the opponents of the Constable, as were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[p. 399]</span> most of his family; but
he does not seem to have shown a factious or violent spirit, and, after
being once unreasonably thrown into prison, found his position so false
and disagreeable, that he retired from affairs altogether.</p>

<p>Among his more cultivated and intellectual friends was the family of
Santa María, two of whom, having been Bishops of Cartagena, are better
known by the name of the see they filled than they are by their own.
The oldest of them all was a Jew by birth,—Selomo Halevi,—who, in 1390,
when he was forty years old, was baptized as Pablo de Santa María, and
rose, subsequently, by his great learning and force of character, to
some of the highest places in the Spanish Church, of which he continued
a distinguished ornament till his death in 1432. His brother, Alvar
Garcia de Santa María, and his three sons, Gonzalo, Alonso, and Pedro,
the last of whom lived as late as the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,
were, like the head of the family, marked by literary accomplishments,
of which the old Cancioneros afford abundant proof, and of which, it
is evident, the court of John the Second was not a little proud. The
connection of Perez de Guzman, however, was chiefly with Alonso, long
Bishop of Cartagena, who wrote for the use of his friend a religious
treatise, and who, when he died, in 1435, was mourned by Perez de
Guzman in a poem comparing the venerable Bishop to Seneca and Plato.<a
id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span></p>

<p>The occupations of Perez de Guzman, in his retirement on his
estates at Batres, where he passed the latter part of his life, and
where he died, about 1470, were suited to his own character and to the
spirit of his age. He wrote a good deal of poetry, such as was then
fashionable among persons of the class to which he belonged, and his
uncle, the Marquis of Santillana, admired what he wrote. Some of it may
be found in the collection of Baena, showing that it was in favor at
the court of John the Second. Yet more was printed in 1492, and in the
Cancioneros that began to appear a few years later; so that it seems to
have been still valued by the limited public interested in letters in
the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p>But the longest poem he wrote, and perhaps the most important,
is his “Praise of the Great Men of Spain,” a kind of chronicle,
filling four hundred and nine octave stanzas; to which should be
added a hundred and two rhymed Proverbs, mentioned by the Marquis
of Santillana, but probably prepared later than the collection made
by the Marquis himself for the education of Prince Henry. After
these, the two poems of Perez de Guzman that make most pretensions
from their length are an allegory on the Four Cardinal Virtues, in
sixty-three stanzas, and another on the Seven Deadly Sins and the
Seven Works of Mercy, in a hundred. The best verses he wrote are
in his short hymns. But all are forgotten, and deserve to be so.<a
id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[p. 401]</span>His prose is
much better. Of the part he bore in the Chronicle of John the Second
notice has already been taken. But at different times, both before he
was engaged in that work and afterwards, he was employed on another,
more original in its character and of higher literary merit. It is
called “Genealogies and Portraits,” and contains, under thirty-four
heads, sketches, rather than connected narratives, of the lives,
characters, and families of thirty-four of the principal persons of
his time, such as Henry the Third, John the Second, the Constable
Alvaro de Luna, and the Marquis of Villena.<a id="FNanchor_675"
href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> A part of this genial
work seems, from internal evidence, to have been written in 1430,
while other portions must be dated after 1454; but none of it can have
been much known till all the principal persons to whom it relates
had died, and not, therefore, till the reign of Henry the Fourth, in
the course of which the death of Perez de Guzman himself must have
happened. It is manly in its tone, and is occasionally marked with
vigorous and original thought. Some of its sketches are, indeed, brief
and dry, like that of Queen Catherine, daughter of John of Gaunt. But
others are long and elaborate, like that of the Infante Don Ferdinand.
Sometimes he discovers a spirit in advance of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span> his age, such as he shows when he defends
the newly converted Jews from the cruel suspicions with which they were
then persecuted. But he oftener discovers a willingness to rebuke its
vices, as when, discussing the character of Gonzalo Nuñez de Guzman, he
turns aside from his subject and says solemnly,—</p>

<p>“And no doubt it is a noble thing and worthy of praise to preserve
the memory of noble families and of the services they have rendered
to their kings and to the commonwealth; but here, in Castile, this
is now held of small account. And, to say truth, it is really little
necessary; for now-a-days he is noblest who is richest. Why, then,
should we look into books to learn what relates to families, since
we can find their nobility in their possessions? Nor is it needful
to keep a record of the services they render; for kings now give
rewards, not to him who serves them most faithfully, nor to him who
strives for what is most worthy, but to him who most follows their
will and pleases them most.”<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676"
class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>In this and other passages, there is something of the tone of a
disappointed statesman, perhaps of a disappointed courtier. But more
frequently, as, for instance, when he speaks of the Great Constable,
there is an air of good faith and justice that do him much honor. Some
of his portraits, among which we may notice those of Villena and John
the Second, are drawn with skill and spirit; and everywhere he writes
in that rich, grave, Castilian style, with now and then a happy and
pointed phrase to relieve its dignity, of which we can find no earlier
example without going quite back to Alfonso the Wise and Don Juan
Manuel.</p>

  the Last. — The Urreas. — Juan de Padilla.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Contemporary</span> with all the authors we
have just examined, and connected by ties of blood with several
of them, was the family of the Manriques,—poets, statesmen, and
soldiers,—men suited to the age in which they lived, and marked with
its strong characteristics. They belonged to one of the oldest and
noblest races of Castile; a race beginning with the Laras of the
ballads and chronicles.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677"
class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Pedro, the father of the first two to be
noticed, was among the sturdiest opponents of the Constable Alvaro de
Luna, and filled so large a space in the troubles of the time, that
his violent imprisonment, just before he died, shook the country to
its very foundations. At his death, however, in 1440, the injustice he
had suffered was so strongly felt by all parties, that the whole court
went into mourning for him, and the good Count Haro—the same in whose
hands the honor and faith of the country had been put in pledge a year
before at Tordesillas—came into the king’s presence, and, in a solemn
scene well described by the chronicler of John the Second, obtained for
the children of the deceased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[p.
404]</span> Manrique a confirmation of all the honors and rights of
which their father had been wrongfully deprived.<a id="FNanchor_678"
href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>One of these children was Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes, a bold
captain, well known by the signal advantages he gained for his country
over the Moors. He was born in 1416, and his name occurs constantly in
the history of his time; for he was much involved, not only in the wars
against the common enemy in Andalusia and Granada, but in the no less
absorbing contests of the factions which then rent Castile and all the
North. But, notwithstanding the active life he led, we are told that he
found time for poetry, and one of his songs, by no means without merit,
which has been preserved to us, bears witness to it. He died in 1476.<a
id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>His brother, Gomez Manrique, of whose life we have less distinct
accounts, but whom we know to have been both a soldier and a lover
of letters, has left us more proofs of his poetical studies and
talent. One of his shorter pieces belongs to the reign of John the
Second, and one of more pretensions comes into the period of the
Catholic sovereigns; so that he lived in three different reigns.<a
id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
At the request of Count Benevente, he at one time collected what
he had written into a volume, which may still be extant, but has
never been published.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681"
class="fnanchor">[681]</a> The longest of his works, now known
to exist, is an allegorical poem of twelve hundred lines on the
death of his uncle, the Marquis of Santillana, in which the Seven
Cardinal Virtues, together with Poetry and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span> Gomez Manrique himself, appear and mourn
over the great loss their age and country had sustained. It was written
soon after 1458, and sent, with an amusingly pedantic letter, to his
cousin, the Bishop of Calahorra, son of the Marquis of Santillana.<a
id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>
Another poem, addressed to Ferdinand and Isabella, which is necessarily
to be dated as late as the year 1474, is a little more than half as
long as the last, but, like that, is allegorical, and resorts to the
same poor machinery of the Seven Virtues, who come this time to give
counsel to the Catholic sovereigns on the art of government. It was
originally preceded by a prose epistle, and was printed in 1482, so
that it is among the earliest books that came from the Spanish press.<a
id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>These two somewhat long poems, with a few that are much shorter,—the
best of which is on the bad government of a town where he lived,—fill
up the list of what remain to us of their author’s works. They are
found in the Cancioneros printed from time to time during the sixteenth
century, and thus bear witness to the continuance of the regard in
which he was long held. But, except a few passages, where he speaks
in a natural tone, moved by feelings of personal affection, none of
his poetry can now be read with pleasure; and, in some instances,
the Latinisms in which he indulges, misled probably by Juan de Mena,
render the lines where they occur quite ridiculous.<a id="FNanchor_684"
href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p. 406]</span>Jorge Manrique
is the last of this chivalrous family that comes into the literary
history of his country. He was the son of Rodrigo, Count of Paredes,
and seems to have been a young man of an uncommonly gentle cast of
character, yet not without the spirit of adventure that belonged to
his ancestors,—a poet full of natural feeling, when the best of those
about him were almost wholly given to metaphysical conceits, and to
what was then thought a curious elegance of style. We have, indeed, a
considerable number of his lighter verses, chiefly addressed to the
lady of his love, which are not without the coloring of his time,
and remind us of the poetry on similar subjects produced a century
later in England, after the Italian taste had been introduced at the
court of Henry the Eighth.<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685"
class="fnanchor">[685]</a> But the principal poem of Manrique the
younger is almost entirely free from affectation. It was written on the
death of his father, which occurred in 1476, and is in the genuinely
old Spanish measure and manner. It fills about five hundred lines,
divided into forty-two <i>coplas</i> or stanzas, and is called, with a
simplicity and directness worthy of its own character, “The Coplas of
Manrique,” as if it needed no more distinctive name.</p>

<p>Nor does it. Instead of being a loud exhibition of his sorrows,
or, what would have been more in the spirit of the age, a conceited
exhibition of his learning, it is a simple and natural complaint
of the mutability of all earthly happiness; the mere overflowing
of a heart filled with despondency at being brought suddenly to
feel the worthlessness of what it has most valued and pursued. His
father occupies hardly half the canvas of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_407">[p. 407]</span> the poem, and some of the stanzas devoted
more directly to him are the only portion of it we could wish away.
But we everywhere feel—before its proper subject is announced quite as
much as afterwards—that its author has just sustained some loss, which
has crushed his hopes, and brought him to look only on the dark and
discouraging side of life. In the earlier stanzas he seems to be in the
first moments of his great affliction, when he does not trust himself
to speak out concerning its cause; when his mind, still brooding in
solitude over his sorrows, does not even look round for consolation. He
says, in his grief,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Our lives are rivers, gliding free</p>
<p class="i0">To that unfathomed, boundless sea,</p>
<p class="i2">The silent grave;</p>
<p class="i0">Thither all earthly pomp and boast</p>
<p class="i0">Roll, to be swallowed up and lost</p>
<p class="i2">In one dark wave.</p>
<p class="i0">Thither the mighty torrents stray,</p>
<p class="i0">Thither the brook pursues its way,</p>
<p class="i2">And tinkling rill.</p>
<p class="i0">There all are equal. Side by side</p>
<p class="i0">The poor man and the son of pride</p>
<p class="i2">Lie calm and still.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The same tone is heard, though somewhat softened, when he touches
on the days of his youth and of the court of John the Second, already
passed away; and it is felt the more deeply, because the festive scenes
he describes come into such strong contrast with the dark and solemn
thoughts to which they lead him. In this respect his verses fall upon
our hearts like the sound of a heavy bell, struck by a light and gentle
hand, which continues long afterwards to give forth tones that grow
sadder and more solemn, till at last they come to us like a wailing
for those we have ourselves loved and lost. But gradually the movement
changes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[p. 408]</span> After his
father’s death is distinctly announced, his tone becomes religious and
submissive. The light of a blessed future breaks upon his reconciled
spirit; and then the whole ends like a mild and radiant sunset,
as the noble old warrior sinks peacefully to his rest, surrounded
by his children and rejoicing in his release.<a id="FNanchor_686"
href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>No earlier poem in the Spanish language, if we except, perhaps, some
of the early ballads, is to be compared with the Coplas of Manrique
for depth and truth of feeling; and few of any subsequent period have
reached the beauty or power of its best portions. Its versification,
too, is excellent; free and flowing, with occasionally an antique air
and turn, that are true to the character of the age that produced it,
and increase its picturesqueness and effect. But its great charm is to
be sought in a beautiful simplicity, which, belonging to no age, is the
seal of genius in all.</p>

<p>The Coplas, as might be anticipated, produced a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[p. 409]</span> strong impression from
the first. They were printed in 1492, within sixteen years after
they were written, and are found in several of the old collections a
little later. Separate editions followed. One, with a very dull and
moralizing prose commentary by Luis de Aranda, was published in 1552.
Another, with a poetical gloss in the measure of the original, by
Luis Perez, appeared in 1561; yet another, by Rodrigo de Valdepeñas,
in 1588; and another, by Gregorio Silvestre, in 1589;—all of which
have been reprinted more than once, and the first two many times.
But in this way the modest Coplas themselves became so burdened and
obscured, that they almost disappeared from general circulation, till
the middle of the last century, since which time, however, they have
been often reprinted, both in Spain and in other countries, until
they seem at last to have taken that permanent place among the most
admired portions of the elder Spanish literature, to which their merit
unquestionably entitles them.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687"
class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[p. 410]</span>The death of
the younger Manrique was not unbecoming his ancestry and his life.
In an insurrection which occurred in 1479, he served on the loyal
side, and pushing a skirmish too adventurously, was wounded and
fell. In his bosom were found some verses, still unfinished, on the
uncertainty of all human hopes; and an old ballad records his fate
and appropriately seals up, with its simple poetry, the chronicle of
this portion, at least, of his time-honored race.<a id="FNanchor_688"
href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>Another family that flourished in the time of Ferdinand and
Isabella, and one that continued to be distinguished in that of Charles
the Fifth, was marked with similar characteristics, serving in high
places in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[p. 411]</span> the state
and in the army, and honored for its success in letters. It was the
family of the Urreas. The first of the name who rose to eminence was
Lope, created Count of Aranda in 1488; the last was Gerónimo de Urrea,
who must be noticed hereafter as the translator of Ariosto, and as the
author of a treatise on Military Honor, which was published in 1566.</p>

<p>Both the sons of the first Count of Aranda, Miguel and Pedro, were
lovers of letters; but Pedro only was imbued with a poetical spirit
beyond that of his age, and emancipated from its affectations and
follies. His poems, which he published in 1513, are dedicated to his
widowed mother, and are partly religious and partly secular. Some of
them show that he was acquainted with the Italian masters. Others are
quite untouched by any but national influences; and among the latter
is the following ballad, recording the first love of his youth, when a
deep distrust of himself seemed to be too strong for a passion which
was yet evidently one of great tenderness:—</p>

</div></div>

<p>The last person who wrote a poem of any considerable length, and yet
is properly to be included within the old school, is one who, by his
imitations of Dante, reminds us of the beginnings of that school in the
days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[p. 413]</span> of the Marquis
of Santillana. It is Juan de Padilla, commonly called “El Cartuxano,”
or The Carthusian, because he chose thus modestly to conceal his
own name, and announce himself only as a monk of Santa María de
las Cuevas in Seville.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690"
class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Before he entered into that severe
monastery, he wrote a poem, in a hundred and fifty <i>coplas</i>, called
“The Labyrinth of the Duke of Cadiz,” which was printed in 1493; but
his two chief works were composed afterwards. The first of them is
called “Retablo de la Vida de Christo,” or A Picture of the Life of
Christ; a long poem, generally in octave stanzas of <i>versos de arte
mayor</i>, containing a history of the Saviour’s life, as given by the
Prophets and Evangelists, but interspersed with prayers, sermons, and
exhortations; all very devout and very dull, and all finished, as he
tells us, on Christmas eve in the year 1500.</p>

<p>The other is entitled “The Twelve Triumphs of the Twelve Apostles,”
which, as we are informed, with the same accuracy and in the same way,
was completed on the 14th of February, 1518; again a poem formidable
for its length, since it fills above a thousand stanzas of nine lines
each. It is partly an allegory, but wholly religious in its character,
and is composed with more care than any thing else its author wrote.
The action passes in the twelve signs of the zodiac, through which
the poet is successively carried by Saint Paul, who shows him, in
each of them, first, the marvels of one of the twelve Apostles; next,
an opening of one of the twelve mouths of the infernal regions;
and lastly, a glimpse of the corresponding division of Purgatory.
Dante is evidently the model of the good monk, however unsuc<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span>cessful he may be as a
follower. Indeed, he begins with a direct imitation of the opening
of the “Divina Commedia,” from which, in other parts of the poem,
phrases and lines are not unfrequently borrowed. But he has thrown
together what relates to earth and heaven, to the infernal regions
and to Purgatory, in such an unhappy confusion, and he so mingles
allegory, mythology, astrology, and known history, that his work turns
out, at last, a mere succession of wild inconsistencies and vague,
unmeaning descriptions. Of poetry there is rarely a trace; but the
language, which has a decided air of yet elder times about it, is
free and strong, and the versification, considering the period, is
uncommonly rich and easy.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691"

  <h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>
  <p class="subh3 hang"><span class="smcap">Prose-writers. — Juan
  de Lucena. — Alfonso de la Torre. — Diego de Almela. — Alonso
  Ortiz. — Fernando del Pulgar. — Diego de San Pedro.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reign of Henry the Fourth, was more
favorable to the advancement of prose composition than that of John the
Second. This we have already seen when speaking of the contemporary
chronicles, and of Perez de Guzman and the author of the “Celestina.”
In other cases, we observe its advancement in an inferior degree, but,
encumbered as they are with more or less of the bad taste and pedantry
of the time, they still deserve notice, because they were so much
valued in their own age.</p>

<p>Regarded from this point of view, one of the most prominent
prose-writers of the century was Juan de Lucena; a personage
distinguished both as a private counsellor of John the Second and as
that monarch’s foreign ambassador. We know, however, little of his
history; and of his works only one remains to us,—if, indeed, he wrote
any more. It is a didactic prose dialogue “On a Happy Life,” carried on
between some of the most eminent persons of the age: the great Marquis
of Santillana, Juan de Mena, the poet, Alonso de Cartagena, the bishop
and statesman, and Lucena himself, who acts in part as an umpire in the
discussion, though the Bishop at last ends it by deciding that true
happiness consists in loving and serving God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[p. 416]</span>The dialogue
itself is represented as having passed chiefly in a hall of the palace,
and in presence of several of the nobles of the court; but it was not
written till after the death of the Constable, in 1453; that event
being alluded to in it. It is plainly an imitation of the treatise of
Boëthius “On the Consolation of Philosophy,” then a favorite classic;
but it is more spirited and effective than its model. It is frequently
written in a pointed, and even a dignified style; and parts of it are
interesting and striking. Thus, the lament of Santillana over the death
of his son is beautiful and touching, and so is the final summing up
of the trials and sorrows of this life by the Bishop. In the midst
of their discussions, there is a pleasant description of a collation
with which they were refreshed by the Marquis, and which recalls, at
once,—as it was probably intended to do,—the Greek Symposia and the
dialogues that record them. Indeed, the allusions to antiquity with
which it abounds, and the citations of ancient authors, which are
still more frequent, are almost always apt, and often free from the
awkwardness and pedantry which mark most of the didactic prose of the
period; so that, taken together, it may be regarded, notwithstanding
the use of many strange words, and an occasional indulgence in
conceits, as one of the most remarkable literary monuments of
the age from which it has come down to us.<a id="FNanchor_692"
href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[p. 417]</span>To this period,
also, we must refer the “Vision Deleytable,” or Delectable Vision,
which we are sure was written before 1463. Its author was Alfonso de la
Torre, commonly called “The Bachelor,” who seems to have been a native
of the bishopric of Burgos, and who was, from 1437 till the time of his
death, a member of the College of Saint Bartholomew at Salamanca; a
noble institution, founded in imitation of that established at Bologna
by Cardinal Albornoz. It is an allegorical vision, in which the author
supposes himself to see the Understanding of Man in the form of an
infant brought into a world full of ignorance and sin, and educated
by a succession of such figures as Grammar, Logic, Music, Astrology,
Truth, Reason, and Nature. He intended it, he says, to be a compendium
of all human knowledge, especially of all that touches moral science
and man’s duty, the soul and its immortality; intimating, at the end,
that it is a bold thing in him to have discussed such subjects in the
vernacular, and begging the noble Juan de Beamonte, at whose request
he had undertaken it, not to permit a work so slight to be seen by
others.</p>

<p>It shows a good deal of the learning of its time, and still more of
the acuteness of the scholastic metaphysics then in favor. But it is
awkward and uninteresting in the general structure of its fiction, and
meagre in its style and illustrations. This, however, did not prevent
it from being much read and admired. There is one edition of it without
date, which probably appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[p.
418]</span> about 1480, showing that the wish of its author to keep
it from the public was not long respected; and there were other
editions in 1489, 1526, and 1538, besides a translation into Catalan,
printed as early as 1484. But the taste for such works passed away
in Spain as it did elsewhere; and the Bachiller de la Torre was soon
so completely forgotten, that his Vision was not only published by
Dominico Delphino in Italian, as a work of his own, but was translated
back into its native Spanish by Francisco de Caceres, a converted Jew,
and printed in 1663, as if it had been an original Italian work till
then quite unknown in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693"
class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>An injustice not unlike the one that occurred to Alfonso de la
Torre happened to his contemporary, Diego de Almela, and for some
time deprived him of the honor, to which he was entitled, of being
regarded as the author of “The Valerius of Stories,”—a book long<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[p. 419]</span> popular and still
interesting. He wrote it after the death of his patron, the wise
Bishop of Cartagena, who had projected such a work himself, and as
early as 1472 it was sent to one of the Manrique family. But though
the letter which then accompanied it is still extant, and though, in
four editions, beginning with that of 1487, the book is ascribed to its
true author, yet in the fifth, which appeared in 1541, it is announced
to be by the well-known Fernan Perez de Guzman;—a mistake which was
discovered and announced by Tamayo de Vargas, in the time of Philip the
Third, but does not seem to have been generally corrected till the work
itself was edited anew by Moreno, in 1793.</p>

<p>It is thrown into the form of a discussion on Morals, in which,
after a short explanation of the different virtues and vices of men,
as they were then understood, we have all the illustrations the author
could collect under each head from the Scriptures and the history of
Spain. It is, therefore, rather a series of stories than a regular
didactic treatise, and its merit consists in the grave, yet simple and
pleasing, style in which they are told,—a style particularly fitted
to most of them, which are taken from the old national chronicles.
Originally, it was accompanied by “An Account of Pitched Battles”; but
this, and his Chronicles of Spain, his collection of the Miracles of
Santiago, and several discussions of less consequence, are long since
forgotten. Almela, who enjoyed the favor of Ferdinand and Isabella,
accompanied those sovereigns to the siege of Granada, in 1491, as a
chaplain, carrying with him, as was not uncommon at that time among
the higher ecclesiastics, a military retinue to serve in the wars.<a
id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[p. 420]</span>In 1493, another
distinguished ecclesiastic, Alonso Ortiz, a canon of Toledo, published,
in a volume of moderate size, two small works which should not be
entirely overlooked. The first is a treatise, in twenty-seven chapters,
addressed, through the queen, Isabella, to her daughter, the Princess
of Portugal, on the death of that princess’s husband, filled with such
consolation as the courtly Canon deemed suitable to her bereavement and
his own dignity. The other is an oration, addressed to Ferdinand and
Isabella, after the fall of Granada, in 1492, rejoicing in that great
event, and glorying almost equally in the cruel expulsion of all Jews
and heretics from Spain. Both are written in too rhetorical a style,
but neither is without merit; and in the oration there are one or two
beautiful and even touching passages on the tranquillity to be enjoyed
in Spain, now that a foreign and hated enemy, after a contest of eight
centuries, had been expelled from its borders,—passages which evidently
came from the writer’s heart, and no doubt found an echo wherever his
words were heard by Spaniards.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695"
class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>Another of the prose-writers of the fifteenth century, and one
that deserves to be mentioned with more respect than either of the
last, is Fernando del Pulgar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[p.
421]</span> He was born in Madrid, and was educated, as he himself
tells us, at the court of John the Second. During the reign of Henry
the Fourth, he had employments which show him to have been a person
of consequence; and during a large part of that of Ferdinand and
Isabella, he was one of their counsellors of state, their secretary,
and their chronicler.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696"
class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Of his historical writings notice has
already been taken; but in the course of his inquiries after what
related to the annals of Castile, he collected materials for another
work, more interesting, if not more important. For he found, as he
says, many famous men whose names and characters had not been so
preserved and celebrated as their merits demanded; and, moved by his
patriotism, and taking for his example the portraits of Perez de Guzman
and the biographies of the ancients, he carefully prepared sketches of
the lives of the principal persons of his own age, beginning with Henry
the Fourth, and confining himself chiefly within the limits of that
monarch’s reign and court.</p>

<p>Some of these sketches, to which he has given the general title
of “Claros Varones de Castilla,” like those of the good Count Haro<a
id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
and of Rodrigo Manrique,<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698"
class="fnanchor">[698]</a> are important for their subjects, while
others, like those of the great ecclesiastics of the kingdom, are now
interesting only for the skill with which they are drawn. The style in
which they are written is forcible and generally concise, showing a
greater tendency to formal elegance than any thing by either Cibdareal
or Guzman, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[p. 422]</span>
whom we should most readily compare him; but we miss the confiding
naturalness of the warm-hearted physician and the severe judgments
of the retired statesman. The whole series is addressed to his great
patroness, Queen Isabella, to whom, no doubt, he thought a tone of
composed dignity more appropriate than any other.</p>

<p>As a specimen of his best manner, we may take the following
passage, in which, after having alluded to some of the most remarkable
personages in Roman history, he turns, as it were, suddenly round
to the queen, and thus boldly confronts the great men of antiquity
with the great men of Castile, whom he had already discussed more at
large:—</p>

<p>“True, indeed, it is, that these great men,—Castilian knights and
gentlemen,—of whom memory is here made for fair cause, and also those
of the elder time, who, fighting for Spain, gained it from the power
of its enemies, did neither slay their own sons, as did those consuls,
Brutus and Torquatus; nor burn their own flesh, as did Scævola; nor
commit against their own blood cruelties which nature abhors and
reason forbids; but rather, with fortitude and perseverance, with wise
forbearance and prudent energy, with justice and clemency, gaining
the love of their own countrymen, and becoming a terror to strangers,
they disciplined their armies, ordered their battles, overcame their
enemies, conquered hostile lands, and protected their own.... So that,
most excellent Queen, these knights and prelates, and many others born
within your realm, whereof here leisure fails me to speak, did, by the
praiseworthy labors they fulfilled, and by the virtues they strove to
attain, achieve unto themselves the name of Famous Men, whereof their
descendants should be above others emulous; while, at the same<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[p. 423]</span> time, all the gentlemen
of your kingdoms should feel themselves called to the same pureness
of life, that they may at last end their days in unspotted success,
even as these great men also lived and died.”<a id="FNanchor_699"
href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>This is certainly remarkable, both for its style and for the tone of
its thought, when regarded as part of a work written at the conclusion
of the fifteenth century. Pulgar’s Chronicle, and his commentary on
“Mingo Revulgo,” as we have already seen, are not so good as such
sketches.</p>

<p>The same spirit, however, reappears in his letters. They are
thirty-two in number; all written during the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella, the earliest being dated in 1473, and the latest only ten
years afterwards. Nearly all of them were addressed to persons of
honorable distinction in his time, such as the queen herself, Henry
the king’s uncle, the Archbishop of Toledo, and the Count of Tendilla.
Sometimes, as in the case of one to the king of Portugal, exhorting him
not to make war on Castile, they are evidently letters of state. But
in other cases, like that of a letter to his physician, complaining
pleasantly of the evils of old age, and one to his daughter, who was a
nun, they seem to be familiar, if not confidential.<a id="FNanchor_700"
href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> On the whole,
therefore, taking all his different works together, we have a very
gratifying exhibition of the character of this ancient servant and
counsellor of Queen Isabella, who, if he gave no considerable impulse
to his age as a writer, was yet in advance of it by the dignity
and elevation of his thoughts and the careless richness of his
style. He died after 1492, and probably before 1500.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[p. 424]</span>We must not,
however, go beyond the limits of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,
without noticing two remarkable attempts to enlarge, or at least to
change, the forms of romantic fiction, as they had been thus far
settled in the books of chivalry.</p>

<p>The first of these attempts was made by Diego de San Pedro,
a senator of Valladolid, whose poetry is found in all the
Cancioneros Generales.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701"
class="fnanchor">[701]</a> He was evidently known at the court of
the Catholic sovereigns, and seems to have been favored there;
but, if we may judge from his principal poem, entitled “Contempt
of Fortune,” his old age was unhappy, and filled with regrets at
the follies of his youth.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702"
class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Among these follies, however, he reckons the
work of prose fiction which now constitutes his only real claim to be
remembered. It is called the Prison of Love, “Carcel de Amor,” and was
written at the request of Diego Hernandez, a governor of the pages in
the time of Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p>It opens with an allegory. The author supposes himself to walk out
on a winter’s morning, and to find in a wood a fierce, savage-looking
person, who drags along an unhappy prisoner bound by a chain.
This savage is Desire, and his victim is Leriano, the hero of the
fiction. San Pedro, from natural sympathy, follows them to the castle
or prison of Love, where, after groping through sundry mystical
passages and troubles, he sees the victim fastened to a fiery seat
and enduring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[p. 425]</span> the
most cruel torments. Leriano tells him that they are in the kingdom
of Macedonia, that he is enamoured of Laureola, daughter of its king,
and that for his love he is thus cruelly imprisoned; all which he
illustrates and explains allegorically, and begs the author to carry
a message to the lady Laureola. The request is kindly granted, and a
correspondence takes place, immediately upon which Leriano is released
from his prison, and the allegorical part of the work is brought to an
end.</p>

<p>From this time the story is much like an episode in one of the
tales of chivalry. A rival discovers the attachment between Leriano
and Laureola, and making it appear to the king, her father, as a
criminal one, the lady is cast into prison. Leriano challenges her
accuser and defeats him in the lists; but the accusation is renewed,
and, being fully sustained by false witnesses, Laureola is condemned to
death. Leriano rescues her with an armed force and delivers her to the
protection of her uncle, that there may exist no further pretext for
malicious interference. The king, exasperated anew, besieges Leriano in
his city of Susa. In the course of the siege, Leriano captures one of
the false witnesses, and compels him to confess his guilt. The king,
on learning this, joyfully receives his daughter again, and shows all
favor to her faithful lover. But Laureola, for her own honor’s sake,
now refuses to hold further intercourse with him; in consequence of
which he takes to his bed and with sorrow and fasting dies. Here the
original work ends; but there is a poor continuation of it by Nicolas
Nuñez, which gives an account of the grief of Laureola and the return
of the author to Spain.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703"
class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[p. 426]</span>The style, so
far as Diego de San Pedro is concerned, is good for the age; very
pithy, and full of rich aphorisms and antitheses. But there is no
skill in the construction of the fable; and the whole work only shows
how little romantic fiction was advanced in the time of Ferdinand
and Isabella. The Carcel de Amor was, however, very successful. The
first edition appeared in 1492; two others followed in less than eight
years; and before a century was completed, it is easy to reckon ten,
beside many translations.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704"
class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>Among the consequences of the popularity enjoyed by the Carcel
de Amor was probably the appearance of the “Question de Amor,” an
anonymous tale, which is dated at the end, 17 April, 1512. It is a
discussion of the question, so often agitated from the age of the
Courts of Love to the days of Garcilasso de la Vega, who suffers most,
the lover whose mistress has been taken from him by death, or the lover
who serves a living mistress without hope. The controversy is here
carried on between Vasquiran, whose lady-love is dead, and Flamiano,
who is rejected and in despair. The scene is laid at Naples and in
other parts of Italy, beginning in 1508, and ending with the battle of
Ravenna and its disastrous consequences, four years later. It is full
of the spirit of the times. Chivalrous games<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_427">[p. 427]</span> and shows at the court of Naples, a
hunting scene, jousts and tournaments, and a tilting-match with reeds,
are all minutely described, with the dresses and armour, the devices
and mottoes, of the principal personages who took part in them.
Poetry, too, is freely scattered through it,—<i>villancicos</i>, <i>motes</i>,
and <i>invenciones</i>, such as are found in the Cancioneros; and, on one
occasion, an entire eclogue is set forth, as it was recited or played
before the court, and, on another, a poetical vision, in which the
lover who had lost his lady sees her again as if in life. The greater
part of the work claims to be true, and some portions of it are known
to be so; but the metaphysical discussion between the two sufferers,
sometimes angrily borne in letters, and sometimes tenderly carried on
in dialogue, constitutes the chain on which the whole is hung, and was
originally, no doubt, regarded as its chief merit. The story ends with
the death of Flamiano from wounds received in the battle of Ravenna;
but the question discussed is as little decided as it is at the
beginning.</p>

<p>The style is that of its age; sometimes picturesque, but generally
dull; and the interest of the whole is small, in consequence both of
the inherent insipidity of such a fine-spun discussion, and of the
too minute details given of the festivals and fights with which it
is crowded. It is, therefore, chiefly interesting as a very early
attempt to write historical romance; just as the “Carcel de Amor,”
which called it forth, is an attempt to write sentimental romance.<a

  <h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>
  <p class="subh3 hang"><span class="smcap">The Cancioneros of
  Baena, Estuñiga, and Martinez de Burgos. — The Cancionero General
  of Castillo. — Its Editions. — Its Divisions, Contents, and
  Character.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reigns of John the Second and of
his children, Henry the Fourth and Isabella the Catholic, over which
we have now passed, extend from 1407 to 1504, and therefore fill
almost a complete century, though they comprise only two generations
of sovereigns. Of the principal writers who flourished while they sat
on the throne of Castile we have already spoken, whether they were
chroniclers or dramatists, whether they were poets or prose-writers,
whether they belonged to the Provençal school or to the Castilian. But,
after all, a more distinct idea of the poetical culture of Spain during
this century, than can be readily obtained in any other way, is to be
gathered from the old Cancioneros; those ample magazines, filled almost
entirely with the poetry of the age that preceded their formation.</p>

<p>Nothing, indeed, that belonged to the literature of the fifteenth
century in Spain marks its character more plainly than these large and
ill-digested collections. The oldest of them, to which we have more
than once referred, was the work of Juan Alfonso de Baena, a converted
Jew, and one of the secretaries of John the Second. It dates, from
internal evidence, between the years 1449 and 1454, and was made, as
the compiler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[p. 429]</span> tells
us in his preface, chiefly to please the king, but also, as he adds,
in the persuasion that it would not be disregarded by the queen, the
heir-apparent, and the court and nobility in general. For this purpose,
he says, he had brought together the works of all the Spanish poets
who, in his own or any preceding age, had done honor to what he calls
“the very gracious art of the <i>Gaya Ciencia</i>.”</p>

<p>On examining the Cancionero of Baena, however, we find that quite
one third of the three hundred and eighty-four manuscript pages it
fills are given to Villasandino,—who died about 1424, and whom Baena
pronounces “the prince of all Spanish poets,”—and that nearly the
whole of the remaining two thirds is divided among Diego de Valencia,
Francisco Imperial, Baena himself, Fernan Perez de Guzman, and Ferrant
Manuel de Lando; while the names of about fifty other persons, some
of them reaching back to the reign of Henry the Third, are affixed to
a multitude of short poems, of which, probably, they were not in all
cases the authors. A little of it, like what is attributed to Macias,
is in the Galician dialect; but by far the greater part was written
by Castilians, who valued themselves upon their fashionable tone more
than upon any thing else, and who, in obedience to the taste of their
time, generally took the light and easy forms of Provençal verse,
and as much of the Italian spirit as they comprehended and knew how
to appropriate. Of poetry, except in some of the shorter pieces of
Ferrant Lando, Alvarez Gato, and Perez de Guzman, the Cancionero of
Baena contains hardly a trace.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706"
class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[p. 430]</span>Many similar
collections were made about the same time, enough of which remain
to show that they were among the fashionable wants of the age,
and that there was little variety in their character. Among them
was the Cancionero in the Limousin dialect already mentioned;<a
id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
that called Lope de Estuñiga’s, which comprises works of
about forty authors;<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708"
class="fnanchor">[708]</a> that collected in 1464 by Fernan
Martinez de Burgos; and no less than seven others, preserved in the
National Library at Paris, all containing poetry of the middle and
latter part of the fifteenth century, often the same authors, and
sometimes the same poems, that are found in Baena and in Estuñiga.<a
id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
They all belong to a state of society in which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_431">[p. 431]</span> the great nobility, imitating the king,
maintained poetical courts about them, such as that of the Marquis of
Villena at Barcelona, or the more brilliant one, perhaps, of the Duke
Fadrique de Castro, who had constantly in his household Puerto Carrero,
Gayoso, Manuel de Lando, and others then accounted great poets. That
the prevailing tone of all this was Provençal we cannot doubt; but that
it was somewhat influenced by a knowledge of the Italian we know from
many of the poems that have been published, and from the intimations of
the Marquis of Santillana in his letter to the Constable of Portugal.<a
id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p>Thus far, more had been done in collecting the poetry of the time
than might have been anticipated from the troubled state of public
affairs; but it had been done only in one direction, and even in that
with little judgment. The king and the more powerful of the nobility
might indulge in the luxury of such Cancioneros and such poetical
courts, but a general poetical culture could not be expected to follow
influences so partial and inadequate. A new order of things, however,
soon arose. In 1474, the art of printing was fairly established in
Spain; and it is a striking fact, that the first book ascertained to
have come from the Spanish press is a collection of poems recited
that year by forty different poets contending for a public prize.<a
id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> No
doubt, such a volume was not compiled on the principle of the elder
manuscript Cancioneros. Still, in some respects, it resembles them,
and in others seems to have been the result of their example. But
however this may be, a collection of poetry was printed at Saragossa,
in 1492, con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[p. 432]</span>taining
the works of nine authors, among whom were Juan de Mena, the younger
Manrique, and Fernan Perez de Guzman; the whole evidently made on the
same principle and for the same purpose as the Cancioneros of Baena
and Estuñiga, and dedicated to Queen Isabella, as the great patroness
of whatever tended to the advancement of letters.<a id="FNanchor_712"
href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>It was a remarkable book to appear within eighteen years after
the introduction of printing into Spain, when little but the most
worthless Latin treatises had come from the national press; but it was
far from containing all the Spanish poetry that was soon demanded. In
1511, therefore, Fernando del Castillo printed at Valencia what he
called a “Cancionero General,” or General Collection of Poetry; the
first book to which this well-known title was ever given. It professes
to contain “many and divers works of all or of the most notable
Troubadours of Spain, the ancient as well as the modern, in devotion,
in morality, in love, in jests, ballads, <i>villancicos</i>, songs, devices,
mottoes, glosses, questions, and answers.” It, in fact, contains poems
attributed to about a hundred different persons, from the time of the
Marquis of Santillana down to the period in which it was made; most
of the separate pieces being placed under the names of those who were
their authors, or were assumed to be so, while the rest are collected
under the respective titles or divisions just enumerated, which
then constituted the favorite subjects and forms of verse at court.
Of proper order or arrangement, of critical judgment, or tasteful
selection, there seems to have been little thought.</p>

<p>The work, however, was successful. In 1514, a new<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[p. 433]</span> edition of it appeared;
and before 1540, six others had followed, at Toledo and Seville,
making, when taken together, eight in less than thirty years; a
number which, if the peculiar nature and large size of the work are
considered, can hardly find its parallel, at the same period, in any
other European literature. Later,—in 1557 and 1573,—yet two other
editions, somewhat enlarged, appeared at Antwerp, whither the inherited
rights and military power of Charles the Fifth had carried a familiar
knowledge of the Spanish language and a love for its cultivation.
In each of the ten editions of this remarkable book, it should be
borne in mind, that we may look for the body of poetry most in favor
at court and in the more refined society of Spain during the whole
of the fifteenth century and the early part of the sixteenth; the
last and amplest of them comprising the names of one hundred and
thirty-six authors, some of whom go back to the beginning of the
reign of John the Second, while others come down to the time of the
Emperor Charles the Fifth.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713"
class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>Taking this Cancionero, then, as a true poetical representative of
the period it embraces, the first thing we observe, on opening it,
is a mass of devotional verse, evidently intended as a vestibule to
conciliate favor for the more secular and free portions that follow.
But it is itself very poor and gross; so poor and so gross, that we
can hardly understand how, at any period, it can have been deemed
religious. Indeed, within a century from the time when the Cancionero
was published, this part of it was already become so offensive to the
Church it had originally served to propitiate, that the whole of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[p. 434]</span> it was cut out of such
printed copies as came within the reach of the ecclesiastical powers.<a
id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt, however, about the devotional purposes for
which it was first destined; some of the separate compositions being by
the Marquis of Santillana, Fernan Perez de Guzman, and other well-known
authors of the fifteenth century, who thus intended to give an odor of
sanctity to their works and lives. A few poems in this division of the
Cancionero, as well as a few scattered in other parts of it, are in the
Limousin dialect; a circumstance which is probably to be attributed to
the fact, that the whole was first collected and published in Valencia.
But nothing in this portion can be accounted truly poetical, and very
little of it religious. The best of its shorter poems is, perhaps, the
following address of Mossen Juan Tallante to a figure of the Saviour
expiring on the cross:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">O God! the infinitely great,</p>
<p class="i2">That didst this ample world outspread,—</p>
<p class="i6">The true! the high!</p>
<p class="i0">And, in thy grace compassionate,</p>
<p class="i2">Upon the tree didst bow thy head,</p>
<p class="i6">For us to die!</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">O! since it pleased thy love to bear</p>
<p class="i2">Such bitter suffering for our sake,</p>
<p class="i6">O Agnus Dei!</p>
<p class="i0">Save us with him whom thou didst spare,</p>
<p class="i2">Because that single word he spake,—</p>
<p class="i6">Memento mei!<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[p. 435]</span>Next after
the division of devotional poetry comes the series of authors upon
whom the whole collection relied for its character and success when
it was first published; a series, to form which, the editor says,
in the original dedication to the Count of Oliva, he had employed
himself during twenty years. Of such of them as are worthy a separate
notice—the Marquis of Santillana, Juan de Mena, Fernan Perez de
Guzman, and the three Manriques—we have already spoken. The rest are
the Viscount of Altamira, Diego Lopez de Haro,<a id="FNanchor_716"
href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Antonio de Velasco,
Luis de Vivero, Hernan Mexia, Suarez, Cartagena, Rodriguez del Padron,
Pedro Torellas, Dávalos,<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717"
class="fnanchor">[717]</a> Guivara, Alvarez Gato,<a id="FNanchor_718"
href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> the Marquis of Astorga,
Diego<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[p. 436]</span> de San Pedro,
and Garci Sanchez de Badajoz,—the last a poet whose versification
is his chief merit, but who was long remembered by succeeding poets
from the circumstance that he went mad for love.<a id="FNanchor_719"
href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> They all belong to the
courtly school; and we know little of any of them except from hints in
their own poems, nearly all of which are so wearisome from their heavy
sameness, that it is a task to read them.</p>

<p>Thus, the Viscount Altamira has a long, dull dialogue between
Feeling and Knowledge; Diego Lopez de Haro has another between Reason
and Thought; Hernan Mexia, one between Sense and Thought; and Costana,
one between Affection and Hope;—all belonging to the fashionable class
of poems called moralities or moral discussions, all in one measure
and manner, and all counterparts to each other in grave, metaphysical
refinements and poor conceits. On the other hand, we have light,
amatory poetry, some of which, like that of Garci Sanchez de Badajoz on
the Book of Job, that of Rodriguez del Padron on the Ten Commandments,
and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[p. 437]</span> of the
younger Manrique on the forms of a monastic profession, irreverently
applied to the profession of love, are, one would think, essentially
irreligious, whatever they may have been deemed at the time they were
written. But in all of them, and, indeed, in the whole series of works
of the twenty different authors filling this important division of the
Cancionero, hardly a poetical thought is to be found, except in the
poems of a few who have already been noticed, and of whom the Marquis
of Santillana, Juan de Mena, and the younger Manrique are the chief.<a
id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>Next after the series of authors just mentioned, we have a
collection of a hundred and twenty-six “Canciones,” or Songs, bearing
the names of a large number of the most distinguished Spanish poets and
gentlemen of the fifteenth century. Nearly all of them are regularly
constructed, each consisting of two stanzas, the first with four
and the second with eight lines,—the first expressing the principal
idea, and the second repeating and amplifying it. They remind us,
in some respects, of Italian sonnets, but are more constrained in
their movement, and fall into a more natural alliance with conceits.
Hardly one in the large collection of the Cancionero is easy or
flowing, and the following, by Cartagena, whose name occurs often,
and who was one of the Jewish family that rose so high in the Church
after its conversion, is above the average merit of its class.<a
id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I know not why first I drew breath,</p>
<p class="i2">Since living is only a strife,</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[p. 438]</span>Where I am rejected of Death,</p>
<p class="i2">And would gladly reject my own life.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">For all the days I may live</p>
<p class="i2">Can only be filled with grief;</p>
<p class="i0">With Death I must ever strive,</p>
<p class="i2">And never from Death find relief.</p>
<p class="i0">So that Hope must desert me at last,</p>
<p class="i2">Since Death has not failed to see</p>
<p class="i2">That life will revive in me</p>
<p class="i0">The moment his arrow is cast.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>This was thought to be a tender compliment to the lady whose
coldness had made her lover desire a death that would not obey his
summons.</p>

<p>Thirty-seven Ballads succeed; a charming collection of wild-flowers,
which have already been sufficiently examined when speaking of
the ballad poetry of the earliest age of Spanish literature.<a
id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>After the Ballads we come to the “Invenciones,” a form of verse
peculiarly characteristic of the period, and of which we have here
two hundred and twenty specimens. They belong to the institutions
of chivalry, and especially to the arrangements for tourneys and
joustings, which were the most gorgeous of the public amusements known
in the reigns of John the Second and Henry the Fourth. Each knight,
on such occasions, had a device, or drew one for himself by lot; and
to this device or crest a poetical explanation was to be affixed by
himself, which was called an <i>invencion</i>. Some of these posies are
very ingenious; for conceits are here in their place. King John, for
instance, drew a prisoner’s cage for his crest, and furnished for its
motto,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[p. 439]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Even imprisonment still is confessed,</p>
<p class="i2">Though heavy its sorrows may fall,</p>
<p class="i0">To be but a righteous behest,</p>
<p class="i0">When it comes from the fairest and best</p>
<p class="i2">Whom the earth its mistress can call.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The well-known Count Haro drew a <i>noria</i>, or a wheel over which
passes a rope, with a series of buckets attached to it, that descend
empty into a well and come up full of water. He gave, for his
<i>invencion</i>,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The full show my griefs running o’er;</p>
<p class="i0">The empty, the hopes I deplore.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On another occasion, he drew, like the king, an emblem of a
prisoner’s cage, and answered to it by an imperfect rhyme,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">In the gaol which you here behold—</p>
<p class="i0">Whence escape there is none, as you see—</p>
<p class="i0">I must live. What a life must it be!<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Akin to the <i>Invenciones</i> were the “Motes con sus Glosas”; mottoes
or short apophthegms, which we find here to the number of above forty,
each accompanied by a heavy, rhymed gloss. The mottoes themselves
are generally proverbs, and have a national and sometimes a spirited
air. Thus, the lady Catalina Manrique took “Never mickle cost but
little,” referring to the difficulty of obtaining her regard, to
which Cartagena answered, with another proverb, “Merit pays all,” and
then explained or mystified both with a tedious gloss. The rest<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[p. 440]</span> are not better, and all
were valued, at the time they were composed, for precisely what now
seems most worthless in them.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725"
class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>The “Villancicos” that follow—songs in the old Spanish measure, with
a refrain and occasionally short verses broken in—are more agreeable,
and sometimes are not without merit. They received their name from
their rustic character, and were believed to have been first composed
by the <i>villanos</i>, or peasants, for the Nativity and other festivals of
the Church. Imitations of these rude roundelays are found, as we have
seen, in Juan de la Enzina, and occur in a multitude of poets since;
but the fifty-four in the Cancionero, many of which bear the names of
leading poets in the preceding century, are too courtly in their tone,
and approach the character of the <i>Canciones</i>.<a id="FNanchor_726"
href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> In other respects,
they remind us of the earliest French madrigals, or, still more,
of the Provençal poems, that are nearly in the same measures.<a
id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p>The last division of this conceited kind of poetry collected
into the first Cancioneros Generales is that called “Preguntas,” or
Questions; more properly, Questions and Answers; since it is merely
a series of riddles, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[p.
441]</span> their solutions in verse. Childish as such trifles may
seem now, they were admired in the fifteenth century. Baena, in the
Preface to his collection, mentions them among its most considerable
attractions; and the series here given, consisting of fifty-five,
begins with such authors as the Marquis of Santillana and Juan de Mena,
and ends with Garci Sanchez de Badajoz, and other poets of note who
lived in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. Probably it was an easy
exercise of the wits in extemporaneous verse practised at the court
of John the Second, as we find it practised, above a century later,
by the shepherds in the “Galatea” of Cervantes.<a id="FNanchor_728"
href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> But the specimens of
it in the Cancioneros are painfully constrained; the answers being
required to correspond in every particular of measure, number, and the
succession of rhymes with those of the precedent question. On the other
hand, the riddles themselves are sometimes very simple, and sometimes
very familiar; Juan de Mena, for instance, gravely proposing that
of the Sphinx of Œdipus to the Marquis of Santillana, as if it were
possible the Marquis had never before heard of it.<a id="FNanchor_729"
href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>Thus far the contents of the Cancionero General date from the
fifteenth century, and chiefly from the middle and latter part of
it. Subsequently, we have a series of poets who belong rather to the
reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, such as Puerto Carrero, the Duke
of Medina Sidonia, Don Juan Manuel of Portugal, Heredia, and a few
others; after which follows, in the early editions, a collection
of what are called “Jests provoking Laughter,”—really, a number of
very gross poems which constitute part of an indecent Cancionero
printed separately at Valencia, several years afterwards, but which
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[p. 442]</span> soon excluded
from the editions of the Cancionero General, where a few trifles,
sometimes in the Valencian dialect, are inserted, to fill up the
space they had occupied.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730"
class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The air of this second grand division
of the collection is, however, like the air of that which precedes
it, and the poetical merit is less. At last, near the conclusion of
the editions of 1557 and 1573, we meet with compositions belonging
to the time of Charles the Fifth, among which are two by Boscan, a
few in the Italian language, and still more in the Italian manner;
all indicating a new state of things, and a new development of the
forms of Spanish poetry.<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731"
class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>But this change belongs to another period of the literature of
Castile, before entering on which we must notice a few circumstances
in the Cancioneros characteristic of the one we have just gone over.
And here the first thing that strikes us is the large number of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[p. 443]</span> persons whose verses are
thus collected. In that of 1535, which may be taken as the average of
the whole series, there are not less than a hundred and twenty. But out
of this multitude, the number really claiming any careful notice is
small. Many persons appear only as the contributors of single trifles,
such as a device or a <i>cancion</i>, and sometimes, probably, never wrote
even these. Others contributed only two or three short poems, which
their social position, rather than their taste or talents, led them
to adventure. So that the number of those appearing in the proper
character of authors in the Cancionero General is only about forty, and
of these not more than four or five deserve to be remembered.</p>

<p>But the rank and personal consideration of those that throng it are,
perhaps, more remarkable than their number, and certainly more so than
their merit. John the Second is there, and Prince Henry, afterwards
Henry the Fourth; the Constable Alvaro de Luna,<a id="FNanchor_732"
href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> the Count Haro, and
the Count of Plasencia; the Dukes of Alva, Albuquerque, and Medina
Sidonia; the Count of Tendilla and Don Juan Manuel; the Marquises of
Santillana, Astorga, and Villa Franca; the Viscount Altamira, and other
leading personages of their time; so that, as Lope de Vega once said,
“most of the poets of that age were great lords, admirals, constables,
dukes, counts, and kings”;<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733"
class="fnanchor">[733]</a> or, in other words, verse-writing was a
fashion at the court of Castile in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[p. 444]</span>This, in fact,
is the character that is indelibly impressed on the collections found
in the old Cancioneros Generales. Of the earliest poetry of the
country, such as it is found in the legend of the Cid, in Berceo,
and in the Archpriest of Hita, they afford not a trace; and if a few
ballads are inserted, it is for the sake of the poor glosses with which
they are encumbered. But the Provençal spirit of the Troubadours is
everywhere present, if not everywhere strongly marked; and occasionally
we find imitations of the earlier Italian school of Dante and his
immediate followers, which are more apparent than successful. The mass
is wearisome and monotonous. Nearly every one of the longer poems
contained in it is composed in lines of eight syllables, divided
into <i>redondillas</i>, almost always easy in their movement, but rarely
graceful; sometimes broken by a regularly recurring verse of only four
or five syllables, and hence called <i>quebrado</i>, but more frequently
arranged in stanzas of eight or ten uniform lines. It is nearly all
amatory, and the amatory portions are nearly all metaphysical and
affected. It is of the court, courtly; overstrained, formal, and cold.
What is not written by persons of rank is written for their pleasure;
and though the spirit of a chivalrous age is thus sometimes brought
out, yet what is best in that spirit is concealed by a prevalent desire
to fall in with the superficial fashions and fantastic fancies that at
last destroyed it.</p>

<p>But it was impossible such a wearisome state of poetical culture
should become permanent in a country so full of stirring interests
as Spain was in the age that followed the fall of Granada and the
discovery of America. Poetry, or at least the love of poetry, made
progress with the great advancement of the nation under Ferdinand
and Isabella; though the taste of the court in whatever<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[p. 445]</span> regarded Spanish
literature continued low and false. Other circumstances, too, favored
the great and beneficial change that was everywhere becoming apparent.
The language of Castile had already asserted its supremacy, and,
with the old Castilian spirit and cultivation, it was spreading into
Andalusia and Aragon, and planting itself amidst the ruins of the
Moorish power on the shores of the Mediterranean. Chronicle-writing was
become frequent, and had begun to take the forms of regular history.
The drama was advanced as far as the “Celestina” in prose, and the more
strictly scenic efforts of Torres Naharro in verse. Romance-writing
was at the height of its success. And the old ballad spirit—the true
foundation of Spanish poetry—had received a new impulse and richer
materials from the contests in which all Christian Spain had borne
a part amidst the mountains of Granada, and from the wild tales of
the feuds and adventures of rival factions within the walls of that
devoted city. Every thing, indeed, announced a decided movement in the
literature of the nation, and almost every thing seemed to favor and
facilitate it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> condition of things in Spain at
the end of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella seemed, as we have
intimated, to announce a long period of national prosperity. But one
institution, destined soon to discourage and check that intellectual
freedom without which there can be no wise and generous advancement
in any people, was already beginning to give token of its great and
blighting power.</p>

<p>The Christian Spaniards had, from an early period, been essentially
intolerant. To their perpetual wars with the Moors had been added,
from the end of the fourteenth century, an exasperated feeling against
the Jews, which the government had vainly endeavoured to control, and
which had shown itself, at different times, in the plunder and murder
of multitudes of that devoted race throughout the country. Both races
were hated by the mass of the Spanish people with a bitter hatred: the
first as their conquerors; the last for the oppressive claims their
wealth had given them on great numbers of the Christian inhabitants.
In relation to both, it was never forgotten that they were the enemies
of that cross under which all true Spaniards had for centuries
gone to battle; and of both it was taught by the priesthood,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[p. 447]</span> and willingly believed
by the laity, that their opposition to the faith of Christ was an
offence against God, which it was a merit in his people to punish.<a
id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
Columbus wearing the cord of Saint Francis in the streets of Seville,
and consecrating to wars against misbelief in Asia the wealth he was
seeking in the New World, whose soil he earnestly desired should never
be trodden by any foot save that of a Roman Catholic Christian, was
but a type of the Spanish character in the age when he adopted it.<a
id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, it was proposed to establish in Spain the
Inquisition, which had been so efficiently used to exterminate the
heresy of the Albigenses, and which had even followed its victims
in their flight from Provence to Aragon, little serious opposition
was made to the undertaking. Ferdinand, perhaps, was not unwil<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[p. 448]</span>ling to see a power
grow up near his throne with which the political government of the
country could hardly fail to be in alliance, while the piety of the
wiser Isabella, which, as we can see from her correspondence with her
confessor, was little enlightened, led her conscience so completely
astray, that she finally asked for the introduction of the Holy
Office into her own dominions as a Christian benefit to her people.<a
id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>
After a negotiation with the court of Rome, and some changes in the
original project, it was therefore established in the city of Seville
in 1481; the first Grand Inquisitors being Dominicans and their first
meeting being held in a convent of their order, on the 2d of January.
Its earliest victims were Jews. Six were burned within four days from
the time when the tribunal first sat, and Mariana states the whole
number of those who suffered in Andalusia alone during the first year
of its existence at two thousand, besides seventeen thousand who
underwent some form of punishment less severe than that of the stake;<a
id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> all,
it should be remembered, being done with the rejoicing assent of the
mass of the people, whose shouts followed the exile of the whole body
of the Jewish race from Spain in 1492, and whose persecution of the
Hebrew blood, wherever found, and however hidden under the disguises
of conversion and baptism, has hardly ceased down to our own days.<a
id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[p. 449]</span>The fall of
Granada, which preceded by a few months this cruel expulsion of the
Jews, placed the remains of the Moorish nation no less at the mercy of
their conquerors. It is true, that, by the treaty which surrendered
the city to the Catholic sovereigns, the property of the vanquished,
their religious privileges, their mosques, and their worship were
solemnly secured to them; but in Spain, whatever portion of the soil
the Christians had wrested from their ancient enemies had always been
regarded only as so much territory restored to its rightful owners,
and any stipulations that might accompany its recovery were rarely
respected. The spirit and even the terms of the capitulation of
Granada were, therefore, soon violated. The Christian laws of Spain
were introduced there; the Inquisition followed; and a persecution
of the descendants of the old Arab invaders was begun by their new
masters, which, after being carried on above a century with constantly
increasing crimes, was ended in 1609, like the persecution of the
Jews, by the forcible expulsion of the whole race.<a id="FNanchor_739"
href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>Such severity brought with it, of course, a great amount of fraud
and falsehood. Multitudes of the followers of Mohammed—beginning with
four thousand whom Cardinal Ximenes baptized on the day when, contrary
to the provisions of the capitulation of Granada, he consecrated the
great mosque of the Albaycin as a Christian temple—were forced to enter
the fold of the Church, without either understanding its doctrines or
desiring to receive its instructions. With these, as with the converted
Jews, the Inquisition was permitted to deal unchecked by the power of
the state. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[p. 450]</span>
were, therefore, from the first, watched; soon they were imprisoned;
and then they were tortured, to obtain proof that their conversion
was not genuine. But it was all done in secrecy and in darkness. From
the moment when the Inquisition laid its grasp on the object of its
suspicions to that of his execution, no voice was heard to issue from
its cells. The very witnesses it summoned were punished with death or
perpetual imprisonment, if they revealed what they had seen or heard
before its dread tribunals; and often of the victim nothing was known,
but that he had disappeared from his accustomed haunts in society,
never again to be seen.</p>

<p>The effect was appalling. The imaginations of men were filled with
horror at the idea of a power so vast and so noiseless; one which was
constantly, but invisibly, around them; whose blow was death, but
whose steps could neither be heard nor followed amidst the gloom into
which it retreated farther and farther as efforts were made to pursue
it. From its first establishment, therefore, while the great body of
the Spanish Christians rejoiced in the purity and orthodoxy of their
faith, and not unwillingly saw its enemies called to expiate their
unbelief by the most terrible of mortal punishments, the intellectual
and cultivated portions of society felt the sense of their personal
security gradually shaken, until, at last, it became an anxious object
of their lives to avoid the suspicions of a tribunal which infused into
their minds a terror deeper and more effectual in proportion as it was
accompanied by a misgiving how far they might conscientiously oppose
its authority. Many of the nobler and more enlightened, especially on
the comparatively free soil of Aragon, struggled against an invasion
of their rights whose consequences they partly foresaw. But the powers
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[p. 451]</span> government
and the Church, united in measures which were sustained by the passions
and religion of the lower classes of society, became irresistible. The
fires of the Inquisition were gradually lighted over the whole country,
and the people everywhere thronged to witness its sacrifices, as acts
of faith and devotion.</p>

<p>From this moment, Spanish intolerance, which through the Moorish
wars had accompanied the contest and shared its chivalrous spirit, took
that air of sombre fanaticism which it never afterwards lost. Soon, its
warfare was turned against the opinions and thoughts of men, even more
than against their external conduct or their crimes. The Inquisition,
which was its true exponent and appropriate instrument, gradually
enlarged its own jurisdiction by means of crafty abuses, as well as by
the regular forms of law, until none found himself too humble to escape
its notice, or too high to be reached by its power. The whole land bent
under its influence, and the few who comprehended the mischief that
must follow bowed, like the rest, to its authority, or were subjected
to its punishments.</p>

<p>From an inquiry into the private opinions of individuals to an
interference with the press and with printed books there was but a
step. It was a step, however, that was not taken at once; partly
because books were still few and of little comparative importance
anywhere, and partly because, in Spain, they had already been subjected
to the censorship of the civil authority, which, in this particular,
seemed unwilling to surrender its jurisdiction. But such scruples were
quickly removed by the appearance and progress of the Reformation of
Luther; a revolution which comes within the next period of the history
of Spanish literature, when we shall find displayed in their broad
practical results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[p. 452]</span>
the influence of the spirit of intolerance and the power of the Church
and the Inquisition on the character of the Spanish people.</p>


<p class="mt2">If, however, before we enter upon this new and more
varied period, we cast our eyes back towards the one over which we have
just passed, we shall find much that is original and striking, and
much that gives promise of further progress and success. It extends
through nearly four complete centuries, from the first breathings of
the poetical enthusiasm of the mass of the people down to the decay of
the courtly literature in the latter part of the reign of Ferdinand
and Isabella; and it is filled with materials destined, at last, to
produce such a school of poetry and elegant prose as, in the sober
judgment of the nation itself, still constitutes the proper body of
the national literature. The old ballads, the old historical poems,
the old chronicles, the old theatre,—all these, if only elements,
are yet elements of a vigor and promise not to be mistaken. They
constitute a mine of more various wealth than had been offered, under
similar circumstances and at so early a period, to any other people.
They breathe a more lofty and a more heroic temper. We feel, as we
listen to their tones, that we are amidst the stir of extraordinary
passions, which give the character an elevation not elsewhere to be
found in the same unsettled state of society. We feel, though the
grosser elements of life are strong around us, that imagination is
yet stronger; imparting to them its manifold hues, and giving them a
power and a grace that form a striking contrast with what is wild or
rude in their original nature. In short, we feel that we are called to
witness the first efforts of a generous people to emancipate themselves
from the cold restraints of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[p.
453]</span> merely material existence, and watch with confidence and
sympathy the movement of their secret feelings and prevalent energies,
as they are struggling upwards into the poetry of a native and earnest
enthusiasm; persuaded that they must, at last, work out for themselves
a literature, bold, fervent, and original, marked with the features
and impulses of the national character, and able to vindicate for
itself a place among the permanent monuments of modern civilization.<a

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> every country that has yet obtained
a rank among those nations whose intellectual cultivation is the
highest, the period in which it has produced the permanent body of
its literature has been that of its glory as a state. The reason is
obvious. There is then a spirit and activity abroad among the elements
that constitute the national character, which naturally express
themselves in such poetry and eloquence as, being the result of the
excited condition of the people and bearing its impress, become for all
future exertions a model and standard that can be approached only when
the popular character is again stirred by a similar enthusiasm. Thus,
the age of Pericles naturally followed the great Persian war; the age
of Augustus was that of a uni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[p.
458]</span>versal tranquillity produced by universal conquest; the age
of Molière and La Fontaine was that in which Louis the Fourteenth was
carrying the outposts of his consolidated monarchy far into Germany;
and the ages of Elizabeth and Anne were the ages of the Armada and of
Marlborough.</p>

<p>Just so it was in Spain. The central point in Spanish history is the
capture of Granada. During nearly eight centuries before that decisive
event, the Christians of the Peninsula were occupied with conflicts
at home, that gradually developed their energies, amidst the sternest
trials and struggles, till the whole land was filled to overflowing
with a power which had hardly yet been felt in the rest of Europe.
But no sooner was the last Moorish fortress yielded up, than this
accumulated flood broke loose from the mountains behind which it had
so long been hidden, and threatened, at once, to overspread the best
portions of the civilized world. In less than thirty years, Charles the
Fifth, who had inherited, not only Spain, but Naples, Sicily, and the
Low Countries, and into whose treasury the untold wealth of the Indies
was already beginning to pour, was elected Emperor of Germany, and
undertook a career of foreign conquest such as had not been imagined
since the days of Charlemagne. Success and glory seemed to wait for him
as he advanced. In Europe, he extended his empire, till it checked the
hated power of Islamism in Turkey; in Africa, he garrisoned Tunis and
overawed the whole coast of Barbary; in America, Cortés and Pizarro
were his bloody lieutenants, and achieved for him conquests more vast
than were conceived in the dreams of Alexander; while, beyond the
wastes of the Pacific, he stretched his discoveries to the Philippines,
and so completed the circuit of the globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[p. 459]</span>This was
the brilliant aspect which the fortunes of his country offered
to an intelligent and imaginative Spaniard in the first half of
the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741"
class="fnanchor">[741]</a> For, as we well know, such men then looked
forward with confidence to the time when Spain would be the head
of an empire more extensive than the Roman, and seem sometimes to
have trusted that they themselves should live to witness and share
its glory. But their forecast was imperfect. A moral power was at
work, destined to divide Europe anew, and place the domestic policy
and the external relations of its principal countries upon unwonted
foundations. The monk Luther was already become a counterpoise to the
military master of so many kingdoms; and from 1552, when Moritz of
Saxony deserted the Imperial standard, and the convention of Passau
asserted for the Protestants the free exercise of their religion, the
clear-sighted conqueror may himself have understood, that his ambitious
hopes of a universal empire, whose seat should be in the South of
Europe and whose foundations should be laid in the religion of the
Church of Rome, were at an end.</p>

<p>But the question, where the line should be drawn between the great
contending parties, was long the subject of fierce wars. The struggle
began with the enunciation of Luther’s ninety-five propositions, and
his burning the Pope’s bulls at Wittenberg. It was ended, as far as
it is yet ended, by the peace of Westphalia.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_460">[p. 460]</span> During the hundred and thirty years that
elapsed between these two points, Spain was indeed far removed from
the fields where the most cruel battles of the religious wars were
fought; but how deep was the interest the Spanish people took in the
contest is plain from the bitterness of their struggle against the
Protestant princes of Germany; from the vast efforts they made to crush
the Protestant rebellion in the Netherlands; from the expedition of the
Armada against Protestant England; and from the interference of Philip
the Second in the affairs of Henry the Third and Henry the Fourth,
when, during the League, Protestantism seemed to be gaining ground in
France;—in short, it may be seen from the presence of Spain and her
armies in every part of Europe, where it was possible to reach and
assail the great movement of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Those, however, who were so eager to check the power of
Protestantism when it was afar off would not be idle when the danger
drew near to their own homes.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742"
class="fnanchor">[742]</a> The first alarm seems to have come from
Rome. In March, 1521, Papal briefs were sent to Spain, warning the
Spanish government to prevent the further introduction of books written
by Luther and his followers, which, it was believed, had been secretly
penetrating into the country for about a year. These briefs, it should
be observed, were addressed to the civil administration, which still,
in form at least, kept an entire control over such subjects. But it
was more natural, and more according to the ideas then prevalent in
other countries as well as in Spain, to look to the ecclesias<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[p. 461]</span>tical power for remedies
in a matter connected with religion; and the great body of the
Spanish people seems willingly to have done so. In less than a month,
therefore, from the date of the briefs in question, and perhaps even
before they were received in Spain, the Grand Inquisitor addressed
an order to the tribunals under his jurisdiction, requiring them to
search for and seize all books supposed to contain the doctrines of
the new heresy. It was a bold measure, but it was a successful one.<a
id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> The
government gladly countenanced it; for, in whatever form Protestantism
appeared, it came with more or less of the spirit of resistance to
all the favorite projects of the Emperor; and the people countenanced
it, because, except a few scattered individuals, all true Spaniards
regarded Luther and his followers with hardly more favor than they did
Mohammed or the Jews.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Supreme Council, as the highest body in the
Inquisition was called, proceeded in their work with a firm and equal
step. By successive decrees, between 1521 and 1535, it was ordained,
that all persons who kept in their possession books infected with
the doctrines of Luther, and even all who failed to denounce such
persons, should be excommunicated and subjected<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_462">[p. 462]</span> to degrading punishments. This gave
the Inquisition a right to inquire into the contents and character
of whatever books were already printed. Next, they arrogated to
themselves the power to determine what books might be sent to the
press; claiming it gradually and with little noise, but effectually,<a
id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> and
if, at first, without any direct grant of authority from the Pope or
from the king of Spain, still necessarily with the implied assent of
both, and generally with means furnished by one or the other. At last,
a sure expedient was found, which left no doubt of the process to be
used, and very little as to the results that would follow.</p>

<p>In 1539, Charles the Fifth obtained a Papal bull authorizing him to
procure from the University of Louvain, in Flanders, where the Lutheran
controversy would naturally be better understood than in Spain, a
list of books dangerous to be introduced into his dominions. It was
printed in 1546, and was the first “Index Expurgatorius” published in
Spain, and the second in the world. Subsequently it was submitted by
the Emperor to the Supreme Council of the Inquisition, under whose
authority additions were made to it; after which it was promulgated
anew in 1550, thus consummating the Inquisitorial jurisdiction over
this great lever of modern progress and civilization,—a jurisdiction,
it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[p. 463]</span> should be noted,
which was confirmed and enforced by the most tremendous of all human
penalties, when, in 1558, Philip the Second ordained the punishments
of confiscation and death against any person who should sell, buy, or
keep in his possession any book prohibited by the Index Expurgatorius
of the Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745"
class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>The contest with Protestantism in Spain, under such auspices,
was short. It began in earnest and in blood about 1559, and was
substantially ended in 1570. At one period, the new doctrine had
made some progress in the monasteries and among the clergy; and
though it never became formidable from the numbers it enlisted,
yet many of those who joined its standard were distinguished by
their learning, their rank, or their general intelligence. But the
higher and more shining the mark, the more it attracted notice and
the more surely it was reached. The Inquisition had already existed
seventy years and was at the height of its power and favor. Cardinal
Ximenes, one of the boldest and most far-sighted statesmen, and one
of the sternest bigots the world ever saw, had for a long period
united in his own person the office of Civil Administrator of Spain
with that of Grand Inquisitor, and had used the extraordi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[p. 464]</span>nary powers such a
position gave him to confirm the Inquisition at home and to spread it
over the newly discovered continent of America.<a id="FNanchor_746"
href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> His successor was
Cardinal Adrien, the favored preceptor of Charles the Fifth, who filled
nearly two years the places of Grand Inquisitor and of Pope; so that,
for a season, the highest ecclesiastical authority was made to minister
to the power of the Inquisition in Spain, as the highest political
authority had done before.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747"
class="fnanchor">[747]</a> And now, after an interval of twenty years,
had come Philip the Second, wary, inflexible, unscrupulous, at the head
of an empire on which, it was boasted, the sun never set, consecrating
all his own great energies and all the resources of his vast dominions
to the paramount object of extirpating every form of heresy from the
countries under his control, and consolidating the whole into one grand
religious empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[p. 465]</span>Still, the
Inquisition, regarded as the chief outward means of driving the
Lutheran doctrines from Spain, might have failed to achieve its work,
if the people, as well as the government, had not been its earnest
allies. But, on all such subjects, the current in Spain had, from
the first, taken only one direction. Spaniards had contended against
misbelief with so implacable a hatred, for centuries, that the spirit
of that old contest had become one of the elements of their national
existence; and now, having expelled the Jews and reduced the Moors to
submission, they turned themselves, with the same fervent zeal, to
purify their soil from what they trusted would prove the last trace
of heretical pollution. To achieve this great object, Pope Paul the
Fourth, in 1558,—the same year in which Philip the Second had decreed
the most odious and awful penalties of the civil government in aid
of the Inquisition,—granted a brief, by which all the preceding
dispositions of the Church against heretics were confirmed, and the
tribunals of the Inquisition were authorized and required to proceed
against all persons supposed to be infected with the new belief, even
though such persons might be bishops, archbishops, or cardinals,
dukes, princes, kings, or emperors;—a power which, taken in all
its relations, was more formidable to the progress of intellectual
improvement than had ever before been granted to any body of men,
civil or ecclesiastical.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748"
class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>The portentous authority thus given was at once freely exercised.
The first public <i>auto da fé</i> of Protestants was held at Valladolid
in 1559, and others followed, both there and elsewhere.<a
id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
The royal family was occasionally present; several persons of rank
suffered; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[p. 466]</span>
a general popular favor evidently followed the horrors that were
perpetrated. The number of victims was not large when compared with
earlier periods, seldom exceeding twenty burned at one time, and fifty
or sixty subjected to cruel and degrading punishments; but many of
those who suffered were, as the nature of the crimes alleged against
them implied, among the leading and active minds of their age. Men of
learning were particularly obnoxious to suspicion, since the cause of
Protestantism appealed directly to learning for its support. Sanchez,
the best classical scholar of his time in Spain, Luis de Leon, the
best Hebrew critic and the most eloquent preacher, and Mariana, the
chief Spanish historian, with other men of letters of inferior name and
consideration, were summoned before the tribunals of the Inquisition,
in order that they might at least avow their submission to its
authority, even if they were not subjected to its censures.</p>

<p>Nor were persons of the holiest lives and the most ascetic tempers
beyond the reach of its mistrust, if they but showed a tendency to
inquiry. Thus, Juan de Avila, known under the title of the Apostle
of Andalusia, and Luis de Granada, the devout mystic, with Teresa de
Jesus and Juan de la Cruz, both of whom were afterwards canonized by
the Church of Rome, all passed through its cells, or in some shape
underwent its discipline. So did some of the ecclesiastics most
distinguished by their rank and authority. Carranza, Archbishop of
Toledo and Primate of Spain, after being tormented eighteen years by
its persecutions, died, at last, in craven submission to its power;
and Cazella, who had been a favorite chaplain of the Emperor Charles
the Fifth, perished in its fires. Even the faith of the principal
personages of the kingdom was inquired into, and, at different
times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[p. 467]</span> proceedings,
sufficient, at least, to assert its authority, were instituted in
relation to Don John of Austria, and the formidable Duke of Alva;<a
id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
proceedings, however, which must be regarded rather as matters of show
than of substance, since the whole institution was connected with the
government from the first, and became more and more subservient to the
policy of the successive masters of the state, as its tendencies were
developed in successive reigns.</p>

<p>The great purpose, therefore, of the government and the Inquisition
may be considered as having been fulfilled in the latter part of the
reign of Philip the Second,—farther, at least, than such a purpose was
ever fulfilled in any other Christian country, and farther than it is
ever likely to be again fulfilled elsewhere. The Spanish nation was
then become, in the sense they themselves gave to the term, the most
thoroughly religious nation in Europe; a fact signally illustrated in
their own eyes a few years afterward, when it was deemed desirable
to expel the remains of the Moorish race from the Peninsula, and
six hundred thousand peaceable and industrious subjects were, from
religious bigotry, cruelly driven out of their native country, amidst
the devout exultation of the whole kingdom,—Cervantes, Lope de
Vega, and others of the principal men of genius then alive, joining
in the general jubilee.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751"
class="fnanchor">[751]</a> From this time, the voice of religious
dissent can hardly be said to have been heard in the land; and the
Inquisition, therefore, down to its overthrow in 1808, was chiefly a
political engine, much occupied about cases connected with the policy
of the state, though under the pretence that they were cases of heresy
or unbelief. The great body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[p.
468]</span> of the Spanish people rejoiced alike in their loyalty
and their orthodoxy; and the few who differed in faith from the
mass of their fellow-subjects were either held in silence by their
fears, or else sunk away from the surface of society the moment their
disaffection was suspected.</p>

<p>The results of such extraordinary traits in the national character
could not fail to be impressed upon the literature of any country, and
particularly upon a literature which, like that of Spain, had always
been strongly marked by the popular temperament and peculiarities. But
the period was not one in which such traits could be produced with
poetical effect. The ancient loyalty, which had once been so generous
an element in the Spanish character and cultivation, was now infected
with the ambition of universal empire, and was lavished upon princes
and nobles who, like the later Philips and their ministers, were
unworthy of its homage; so that, in the Spanish historians and epic
poets of this period, and even in more popular writers, like Quevedo
and Calderon, we find a vainglorious admiration of their country, and a
poor flattery of royalty and rank, that remind us of the old Castilian
pride and deference only by showing how both had lost their dignity.
And so it is with the ancient religious feeling that was so nearly
akin to this loyalty. The Christian spirit, which gave an air of duty
to the wildest forms of adventure throughout the country, during its
long contest with the power of misbelief, was now fallen away into a
low and anxious bigotry, fierce and intolerant towards every thing that
differed from its own sharply defined faith, and yet so pervading and
so popular, that the romances and tales of the time are full of it, and
the national theatre, in more than one form, becomes its strange and
grotesque monument.</p>

<p>Of course, the body of Spanish poetry and eloquent<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[p. 469]</span> prose produced during
this interval—the earlier part of which was the period of the greatest
glory Spain ever enjoyed—was injuriously affected by so diseased a
condition of the national character. That generous and manly spirit
which is the breath of intellectual life to any people was restrained
and stifled. Some departments of literature, such as forensic
eloquence and eloquence of the pulpit, satirical poetry, and elegant
didactic prose, hardly appeared at all; others, like epic poetry, were
strangely perverted and misdirected; while yet others, like the drama,
the ballads, and the lighter forms of lyrical verse, seemed to grow
exuberant and lawless, from the very restraints imposed on the rest;
restraints which, in fact, forced poetical genius into channels where
it would otherwise have flowed much more scantily and with much less
luxuriant results.</p>

<p>The books that were published during the whole period on which we
are now entering, and indeed for a century later, bore everywhere
marks of the subjection to which the press and those who wrote for it
were alike reduced. From the abject title-pages and dedications of the
authors themselves, through the crowd of certificates collected from
their friends to establish the orthodoxy of works that were often as
little connected with religion as fairy tales, down to the colophon,
supplicating pardon for any unconscious neglect of the authority of the
Church or any too free use of classical mythology, we are continually
oppressed with painful proofs, not only how completely the human mind
was enslaved in Spain, but how grievously it had become cramped and
crippled by the chains it had so long worn.</p>

<p>But we shall be greatly in error, if, as we notice these deep marks
and strange peculiarities in Spanish literature, we suppose they were
produced by the direct ac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[p.
470]</span>tion either of the Inquisition or of the civil government of
the country, compressing, as if with a physical power, the whole circle
of society. This would have been impossible. No nation would have
submitted to it; much less so high-spirited and chivalrous a nation as
the Spanish in the reign of Charles the Fifth and in the greater part
of that of Philip the Second. This dark work was done earlier. Its
foundations were laid deep and sure in the old Castilian character. It
was the result of the excess and misdirection of that very Christian
zeal which fought so fervently and gloriously against the intrusion of
Mohammedanism into Europe, and of that military loyalty which sustained
the Spanish princes so faithfully through the whole of that terrible
contest;—both of them high and ennobling principles, which in Spain
were more wrought into the popular character than they ever were in any
other country.</p>

<p>Spanish submission to an unworthy despotism, and Spanish bigotry,
were, therefore, not the results of the Inquisition and the modern
appliances of a corrupting monarchy; but the Inquisition and the
despotism were rather the results of a misdirection of the old
religious faith and loyalty. The civilization that recognized such
elements presented, no doubt, much that was brilliant, picturesque, and
ennobling; but it was not without its darker side; for it failed to
excite and cherish many of the most elevating qualities of our common
nature,—those qualities which are produced in domestic life, and result
in the cultivation of the arts of peace.</p>

<p>As we proceed, therefore, we shall find, in the full development
of the Spanish character and literature, seeming contradictions,
which can be reconciled only by looking back to the foundations on
which they both rest. We shall find the Inquisition at the height of
its power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[p. 471]</span> and a
free and immoral drama at the height of its popularity,—Philip the
Second and his two immediate successors governing the country with the
severest and most jealous despotism, while Quevedo was writing his
witty and dangerous satires, and Cervantes his genial and wise Don
Quixote. But the more carefully we consider such a state of things, the
more we shall see that these are moral contradictions which draw after
them grave moral mischiefs. The Spanish nation, and the men of genius
who illustrated its best days, might be light-hearted because they did
not perceive the limits within which they were confined, or did not,
for a time, feel the restraints that were imposed upon them. What they
gave up might be given up with cheerful hearts, and not with a sense
of discouragement and degradation; it might be done in the spirit of
loyalty and with the fervor of religious zeal; but it is not at all the
less true that the hard limits were there, and that great sacrifices of
the best elements of the national character must follow.</p>

<p>Of this time gave abundant proof. Only a little more than a century
elapsed before the government that had threatened the world with a
universal empire was hardly able to repel invasion from abroad, or
maintain the allegiance of its own subjects at home. Life—the vigorous,
poetical life which had been kindled through the country in its ages
of trial and adversity—was evidently passing out of the whole Spanish
character. As a people, they sunk away from being a first-rate power
in Europe, till they became one of altogether inferior importance
and consideration; and then, drawing back haughtily behind their
mountains, rejected all equal intercourse with the rest of the world,
in a spirit almost as exclusive and intolerant as that in which they
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[p. 472]</span> formerly
refused intercourse with their Arab conquerors. The crude and gross
wealth poured in from their American possessions sustained, indeed,
for yet another century the forms of a miserable political existence
in their government; but the earnest faith, the loyalty, the dignity
of the Spanish people were gone; and little remained in their place,
but a weak subserviency to the unworthy masters of the state, and a
low, timid bigotry in whatever related to religion. The old enthusiasm,
rarely directed by wisdom from the first, and often misdirected
afterwards, faded away; and the poetry of the country, which had always
depended more on the state of the popular feeling than any other poetry
of modern times, faded and failed with it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was, no doubt, a great decay of
letters and good taste in Spain during the latter part of the troubled
reign of John the Second and the whole of the still more disturbed
period when his successor, Henry the Fourth, sat upon the throne of
Castile. The Provençal school had passed away, and its imitations in
Castilian had not been successful. The earlier Italian influences,
less fertile in good results than might have been anticipated, were
almost forgotten. The fashion of the court, therefore, in the absence
of better or more powerful impulses, ruled over every thing, and a
monotonous poetry, full of conceits and artifices, was all that its own
artificial character could produce.</p>

<p>Nor was there much improvement in the time of Ferdinand and
Isabella. The introduction of the art of printing and the revival of a
regard for classical antiquity were, indeed, foundations for a national
culture such as had not before been laid; while, at the same time, the
establishment of the University of Alcalá, by Cardinal Ximenes, and
the revival of that of Salamanca, with the labors of such scholars as
Peter Martyr, Lucio Marineo, Antonio de Lebrija, and Arias Barbosa,
could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[p. 474]</span> hardly fail
to exercise a favorable influence on the intellectual cultivation,
if not on the poetical taste, of the country. Occasionally, as we
have seen, proofs of the old energy appeared in such works as the
“Celestina” and the “Coplas” of Manrique. The old ballads, too, and
the other forms of the early popular poetry, no doubt, maintained
their place in the hearts of the common people. But it is not to be
concealed, that, among the cultivated classes,—as the Cancioneros
and nearly every thing else that came from the press in the time of
Ferdinand and Isabella sufficiently prove,—taste was at a very low
ebb.</p>

<p>The first impulse to a better state of things came from Italy. In
some respects this was unhappy; but there can be little doubt that
it was inevitable. The intercourse between Italy and Spain, shortly
before the accession of Charles the Fifth, had been much increased,
chiefly by the conquest of Naples, but partly by other causes. Regular
interchanges of ambassadors took place between the See of Rome and
the court of Ferdinand and Isabella, and one of them was a son of the
poetical Marquis of Santillana, and another the father of Garcilasso
de la Vega. The universities of Italy continued to receive large
numbers of Spanish students, who still regarded the means of a generous
education at home as inadequate to their wants; and Spanish poets,
among whom were Juan de la Enzina and Torres Naharro, resorted there
freely, and lived with consideration at Rome and Naples. In the latter
city, the old Spanish family of Dávalos—one of whom was the husband of
that Vittoria Colonna whose poetry ranks with the Italian classics—were
among the chief patrons of letters during their time, and kept alive
an intellectual union be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[p.
475]</span>tween the two countries, by which they were equally
claimed and on which they reflected equal honor.<a id="FNanchor_752"
href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>But besides these individual instances of connection between Spain
and Italy, the gravest events were now drawing together the greater
interests of the mass of the people in both countries, and fastening
their thoughts intently upon each other. Naples, after the treaty of
1503 and the brilliant successes of Gonzalvo de Córdova, was delivered
over to Spain, bound hand and foot, and was governed, above a century,
by a succession of Spanish viceroys, each accompanied by a train of
Spanish officers and dependants, among whom, not unfrequently, we
find men of letters and poets, like the Argensolas and Quevedo. When
Charles the Fifth ascended the throne, in 1516, it was apparent that
he would at once make an effort to extend his political and military
power throughout Italy. The tempting plains of Lombardy became,
therefore, the theatre of the first great European contest entered
into by Spain,—a grand arena, in which, as it proved, much of the fate
of Europe, as well as of Italy, was to be decided by two young and
passionate monarchs, burning with personal rivalship and the love of
glory. In this way, from 1522, when the first war broke out between
Francis the First and Charles the Fifth, to the disastrous battle of
Pavia, in 1525, we may consider the whole disposable force of Spain to
have been transferred to Italy, and subjected, in a remarkable degree,
to the influences of Italian culture and civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[p. 476]</span>Nor did the
connection between the two countries stop here. In 1527, Rome itself
was, for a moment, added to the conquests of the Spanish crown, and
the Pope became the prisoner of the Emperor, as the king of France
had been before. In 1530, Charles appeared again in Italy, surrounded
by a splendid Spanish court, and at the head of a military power that
left no doubt of his mastery. He at once crushed the liberties of
Florence and restored the aristocracy of the Medici. He made peace
with the outraged Pope. By his wisdom and moderation, he confirmed his
friendly relations with the other states of Italy; and, as the seal
of all his successes, he caused himself, in the presence of whatever
was most august in both countries, to be solemnly crowned King of
Lombardy and Emperor of the Romans, by the same Pope whom, three
years before, he had counted among his captives.<a id="FNanchor_753"
href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> Such a state of things
necessarily implied a most intimate connection between Spain and Italy;
and this connection was maintained down to the abdication of the
Emperor, in 1555, and, indeed, long afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_754"
href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it should be remembered that Italy was now
in a condition to act with all the power<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_477">[p. 477]</span> of a superior civilization and refinement
on this large body of Spaniards, many of them the leading spirits of
the Empire, who, by successive wars and negotiations, were thus kept
for half a century travelling in Italy and living at Genoa, Milan, and
Venice, Florence, Rome, and Naples. The age of Lorenzo de’ Medici was
already past, leaving behind it the memorials of Poliziano, Boiardo,
Pulci, and Leonardo da Vinci. The age of Leo the Tenth and Clement
the Seventh was contemporary, and had brought with it the yet more
prevalent influences of Michel Angelo, Raffaelle, and Titian, of
Machiavelli, of Berni, of Ariosto, of Bembo, and of Sannazaro; the last
of whom, it is not unworthy of notice, was himself a descendant of one
of those very Spanish families whom the political interests of the two
countries had originally carried to Naples. It was, therefore, when
Rome and Naples, Florence and the North of Italy, were in the maturity
of their glory, as seats of the arts and letters, that no small part
of what was most noble and cultivated in Spain was led across the Alps
and awakened to a perception of such forms and creations of genius and
taste as had not been attempted beyond the Pyrenees, and such as could
not fail to produce their full effect on minds excited, like those
of the whole Spanish people, by the glorious results of their long
struggle against the Moors, and their present magnificent successes
both in America and Europe.</p>

<p>Visible traces of the influence of Italian literature might,
therefore, from general causes, soon be looked for in the Spanish; but
an accident brings them to our notice somewhat earlier, perhaps, than
might have been anticipated. Juan Boscan, a patrician of Barcelona,
was, as he himself tells us, devoted to poetry from his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[p. 478]</span> youth. The city to
which he belonged had early been distinguished for the number of
Provençal and Catalonian Troubadours who had flourished in it. But
Boscan preferred to write in the Castilian; and his defection from
his native dialect became, in some sort, the seal of its fate. His
earlier efforts, a few of which remain to us, are in the style of the
preceding century; but at last, when, from the most distinct accounts
we can obtain, he was about twenty-five years old, and when, we are
assured, he had been received at court, had served in the army, and
had visited foreign countries, he was induced, by an accident, to
attempt the proper Italian measures, as they were then practised.<a
id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>He became, at that period, acquainted with Andrea Navagiero,
who was sent, in 1524, as ambassador from Venice to Charles the
Fifth, and returned home in 1528, carrying with him a dry, but
valuable, itinerary, which was afterwards published as an account of
his travels. He was a man of learning and a poet, an orator and a
statesman of no mean name.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756"
class="fnanchor">[756]</a> While in Spain, he spent, during the year
1526, six months at Granada.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757"
class="fnanchor">[757]</a> “Being with Navagiero there one day,” says
Boscan, “and discoursing with him about matters of wit and letters,
and especially about the different forms they take in different
languages, he asked me why I did not make an experiment in Castilian
of sonnets and the other forms of verse used by good Italian authors;
and not only spoke to me of it thus slightly, but urged me much to do
it. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[p. 479]</span> few days
afterwards, I set off for my own home; and whether it were the length
and solitariness of the way I know not, but, turning over different
things in my mind, I came often back upon what Navagiero had said to
me. And thus I began to try this kind of verse. At first, I found it
somewhat difficult; for it is of a very artful construction, and in
many particulars different from ours. But afterwards it seemed to
me,—perhaps from the love we naturally bear to what is our own,—that
I began to succeed very well, and so I went on, little by little,
with increasing zeal.”<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758"
class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>This account is interesting and important. It is rare that any
one individual has been able to exercise such an influence on the
literature of a foreign nation as was exercised by Navagiero. It is
still more rare,—indeed, perhaps, wholly unknown, in any case where it
may have occurred,—that the precise mode in which it was exercised can
be so exactly explained. Boscan tells us not only what he did, but what
led him to do it, and how he began his work, which we find him, from
this moment, following up, till he devoted himself to it entirely, and
wrote in all the favorite Italian measures and forms with boldness and
success. He was resisted, but he tells us Garcilasso sustained him;
and from this small beginning in a slight conversation with Navagiero
at Granada, a new school was introduced into Spanish poetry, which has
prevailed in it ever since, and materially influenced its character and
destinies.</p>

<p>Boscan felt his success. This we can see from his own account of it.
But he made little effort to press his example on others; for he was a
man of fortune and consideration, who led a happy life with his family
at Bar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[p. 480]</span>celona, and
hardly cared for popular reputation or influence. Occasionally, we are
told, he was seen at court; and at one period he had some charge of the
education of that Duke of Alva whose name, in the next reign, became so
formidable. But in general he preferred a life of retirement to any of
the prizes offered to ambition.</p>

<p>Letters were his amusement. “In what I have written,” he says,
“the mere writing was never my object; but rather to solace such
faculties as I have, and to go less heavily through certain heavy
passages of my life.”<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759"
class="fnanchor">[759]</a> The range of his studies, however, was wider
than this remark might seem to imply, and wider than was common in
Spain at the beginning of the sixteenth century, even among scholars.
He translated a tragedy of Euripides, which was licensed to be
published, but which never appeared in print, and is, no doubt, lost.<a
id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
On the basis of the “Hero and Leander” of Musæus, and following the
example of Bernardo Tasso, he wrote, in the <i>versi sciolti</i>, or
blank verse, of the Italians, a tale nearly three thousand lines
long, which may still be read with pleasure, for the gentle and
sweet passages it contains.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761"
class="fnanchor">[761]</a> And in general, throughout his poetry,
he shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[p. 481]</span> that
he was familiar with the Greek and Latin classics, and imbued, to a
considerable degree, with the spirit of antiquity.</p>

<p>His longest work was a translation of the Italian “Courtier”
of Balthazar Castiglione,—the best book on good-breeding, as Dr.
Johnson thought two centuries afterwards, that was ever written.<a
id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>
Boscan, however, frankly says, that he did not like the business of
translating, which he regarded as “a low vanity, beseeming men of
little knowledge”; but Garcilasso de la Vega had sent him a copy of
the original soon after it was published, and he made this Spanish
version of it, he tells us, “at his friend’s earnest request.”<a
id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
Either or both of them may have known its author in the same way Boscan
knew Navagiero; for Castiglione was sent as ambassador of Clement the
Seventh to Spain in 1525, and remained there till his death, which
happened at Toledo, in 1529.</p>

<p>But however this may have been, the Italian original of the Courtier
was prepared for the press in Spain and first printed in 1528;<a
id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
soon after which Boscan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[p.
482]</span> must have made his translation, though it did not appear
till 1540. As a version, it does not profess to be very strict, for
Boscan says he thought an exact fidelity to be unworthy of him;<a
id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> but,
as a Spanish composition, it is uncommonly flowing and easy. Garcilasso
declares that it reads like an original work;<a id="FNanchor_766"
href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> and Morales, the
historian, says, “The Courtier discourseth not better in Italy,
where he was born, than here in Spain, where Boscan hath exhibited
him so admirably well.”<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767"
class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Perhaps nothing in Castilian prose, of an
earlier date, is written in so classical and finished a style as this
translation by Boscan.</p>

<p>With such occupations Boscan filled up his unostentatious life. He
published nothing, or very little, and we have no single date to record
concerning him. But, from the few facts that can be collected, it seems
probable he was born before 1500, and we know that he died as early
as 1543; for in that year his works were published at Barcelona, by
his widow, under a license from the Emperor Charles the Fifth, with a
Preface, in which she says her husband had partly prepared them for the
press, because he feared they would be printed from some of the many
imperfect copies that had gone into circulation without his consent.</p>

<p>They are divided into four books. The first consists of a small
number of poems in what are called <i>coplas Españolas</i>, or what he
himself elsewhere terms “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[p.
483]</span> Castilian manner.” These are his early efforts, made
before his acquaintance with Navagiero. They are <i>villancicos</i>,
<i>canciones</i>, and <i>coplas</i>, in the short national verses, and seem as
if they might have come out of the old Cancioneros, in which, indeed,
two of them are to be found.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768"
class="fnanchor">[768]</a> Their merit is not great; but, amidst
their ingenious conceits, there is sometimes a happiness and grace of
expression rarely granted to the poets of the same school in that or
the preceding century.</p>

<p>The second and third books, constituting by far the larger part of
the volume, are composed entirely of poems in the Italian measure.
They consist of ninety-three sonnets and nine <i>canzones</i>; the long
poem on Hero and Leander, in blank verse, already mentioned; an elegy
and two didactic epistles, in <i>terza rima</i>; and a half-narrative,
half-allegorical poem, in one hundred and thirty-five octave stanzas.
It is not necessary to go beyond such a mere enumeration of the
contents of these two books to learn, that, at least so far as their
forms are concerned, they have nothing to do with the elder national
Castilian poetry. The sonnets and the <i>canzones</i> especially are
obvious imitations of Petrarch, as we can see in the case of the two
beginning, “Gentil Señora mia,” and “Claros y frescos rios,” which are
largely indebted to two of the most beautiful and best-known <i>canzones</i>
of the lover of Laura.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769"
class="fnanchor">[769]</a> In most of these poems, however, and amidst
a good deal of hardness of manner, a Spanish tone and spirit are
perceptible, which rescue them, in a great degree, from the imputation
of being copies. Boscan’s colors are here laid<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_484">[p. 484]</span> on with a bolder hand than those of
his Italian master, and there is an absence of that delicate and
exact finish, both in language and style, which, however charming
in his models, would hardly be possible in the most skilful Spanish
imitations.</p>

<p>The elegy, which is merely entitled “Capitolo,” has more conceits
and learning in it than become its subject, and approaches nearer to
Boscan’s first manner than any of his later poems. It is addressed
to his lady-love; but, notwithstanding its defects, it contains long
passages of tenderness and simple beauty that will always be read with
pleasure. Of the two epistles, the first is poor and affected; but that
addressed to the old statesman, poet, and soldier, Diego de Mendoza,
is much in the tone and manner of Horace,—acute, genial, and full of
philosophy.</p>

<p>But the most agreeable and original of Boscan’s works is the last
of them all,—“The Allegory.” It opens with a gorgeous description of
the Court of Love, and with the truly Spanish idea of a corresponding
and opposing Court of Jealousy; but almost the whole of the rest
consists of an account of the embassy of two messengers from the first
of these courts to two ladies of Barcelona who had refused to come
beneath its empire, and to persuade whom to submission a speech of
the ambassador is given that fills nearly half the poem, and ends it
somewhat abruptly. No doubt, the whole was intended as a compliment
to the two ladies, in which the story is of little consequence. But
it is a pleasing and airy trifle, in which its author has sometimes
happily hit the tone of Ariosto, and at other times reminds us of the
Island of Love in the “Lusiad,” though Boscan preceded Camoens by many
years. Occasionally, too, he has a moral delicacy, more refined than
Petrarch’s, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[p. 485]</span>
perhaps suggested by that of the great Italian; such a delicacy as he
shows in the following stanza, and two or three preceding and following

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Boscan might, probably, have done more for the literature of his
country than he did. His poetical talents were not, indeed, of the
highest order; but he perceived the degradation into which Spanish
poetry had fallen, and was persuaded that the way to raise it again
was to give it an ideal character and classical forms such as it had
not yet known. But to accomplish this, he adopted a standard not
formed on the intimations of the national genius. He took for his
models foreign masters, who, though more advanced than any he could
find at home, were yet entitled to supremacy in no literature but
their own, and could never constitute a safe foundation whereon to
build a great and permanent school of Spanish poetry. Entire success,
therefore, was impossible to him. He was able to establish in Spain
the Italian eleven-syllable and iambic versification; the sonnet<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[p. 486]</span> and <i>canzone</i>, as
settled by Petrarch; Dante’s <i>terza rima</i>;<a id="FNanchor_771"
href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> and Boccaccio’s and
Ariosto’s flowing octaves;—all in better taste than any thing among the
poets of his time and country, and all of them important additions to
the forms of verse before known in Spain. But he could go no farther.
The original and essential spirit of Italian poetry could no more be
transplanted to Castile or Catalonia than to Germany or England.</p>

<p>But whatever were his purposes and plans for the advancement of
the literature of his country, Boscan lived long enough to see them
fulfilled, so far as they were ever destined to be; for he had a friend
who cooperated with him in all of them from the first, and who, with
a happier genius, easily surpassed him, and carried the best forms of
Italian verse to a height they never afterwards reached in Spanish
poetry. This friend was Garcilasso de la Vega, who yet died so young,
that Boscan survived him several years.</p>

<p>Garcilasso was descended from an ancient family in the North of
Spain, who traced back their ancestry to the age of the Cid, and who,
from century to century, had been distinguished by holding some of
the highest places in the government of Castile.<a id="FNanchor_772"
href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> A poetical tradition
says, that one of his forefathers obtained the name of “Vega” or
Plain, and the motto of “Ave Maria” for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_487">[p. 487]</span> his family arms, from the circumstance,
that, during one of the sieges of Granada, he slew outright, before
the face of both armies, a Moorish champion who had publicly insulted
the Christian faith by dragging a banner inscribed with “Ave Maria”
at his horse’s heels,—a tradition faithfully preserved in a fine old
ballad, and forming the catastrophe of one of Lope de Vega’s plays.<a
id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> But
whether all this be true or not, Garcilasso bore a name honored on both
sides of his house; for his mother was daughter and sole heir of Fernan
Perez de Guzman, and his father was the ambassador of the Catholic
sovereigns at Rome in relation to the troublesome affairs of Naples.</p>

<p>He was born at Toledo in 1503, and was educated there till he
reached an age suitable for bearing arms. Then, as became his rank
and pretensions, he was sent to court, and received his place in the
armies that were already gaining so much glory for their country. When
he was about twenty-seven years old, he married an Aragonese lady
attached to the court of Eleanor, widow of the king of Portugal, who,
in 1530, was in Spain on her way to become queen of France. From this
time he seems to have been constantly in the wars which the Emperor was
carrying on in all directions, and to have been much trusted by him,
though his elder brother, Pedro, had been implicated in the trou<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[p. 488]</span>bles of the <i>Comunidades</i>,
and compelled to escape from Spain as an outlawed rebel.<a
id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>In 1532 Garcilasso was at Vienna, and among those who distinguished
themselves in the defeat of the Turkish expedition of Soliman, which
that great sultan pushed to the very gates of the city. But while
he was there, he was himself involved in trouble. He undertook to
promote the marriage of one of his nephews with a lady of the Imperial
household; and, urging his project against the pleasure of the
Empress, not only failed, but was cast into prison on an island in
the Danube, where he wrote the melancholy lines on his own desolation
and on the beauty of the adjacent country, which pass as the third
<i>Cancion</i> in his works.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775"
class="fnanchor">[775]</a> The progress of events, however, not only
soon brought his release, but raised him into higher favor than
ever. In 1535 he was at the siege of Tunis,—when Charles the Fifth
attempted to crush the Barbary powers by a single blow,—and there
received two severe wounds, one on his head and the other in his arm.<a
id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
His return to Spain is recorded in an elegy, written at the foot of
Mount Ætna, and indicating that he came back by the way of Naples;
a city which, from another poem addressed to Boscan, he seems to
have visited once before.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777"
class="fnanchor">[777]</a> At any rate, we know, though his present
visit to Italy was a short one, that he was there, at some period, long
enough to win the personal esteem and regard of Bembo and Tansillo.<a
id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>The very next year, however,—the last of his short life,—we
find him again at the court of the Emperor,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_489">[p. 489]</span> and engaged in the disastrous expedition
into Provence. The army had already passed through the difficulties
and dangers of the siege of Marseilles, and was fortunate enough
not to be pursued by the cautious Constable de Montmorenci. But as
they approached the town of Frejus, a small castle, on a commanding
hill, defended by only fifty of the neighbouring peasantry, offered
a serious annoyance to their farther passage. The Emperor ordered
the slight obstacle to be swept from his path. Garcilasso, who had
now a considerable command, advanced gladly to execute the Imperial
requisition. He knew that the eyes of the Emperor, and indeed those of
the whole army, were upon him; and, in the true spirit of knighthood,
he was the first to mount the wall. But a well-directed stone
precipitated him into the ditch beneath. The wound, which was on his
head, proved mortal, and he died a few days afterwards, at Nice, in
1536, only thirty-three years old. His fate is recorded by Mariana,
Sandoval, and the other national historians, among the important
events of the time; and the Emperor, we are told, basely avenged it by
putting to death all the survivors of the fifty peasantry, who had done
no more than bravely defend their homes against a foreign invader.<a
id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>In a life so short and so crowded with cares and adventures we
should hardly expect to find leisure for poetry. But, as he describes
himself in his third Eclogue, Garcilasso seems to have hurried through
the world,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[p. 490]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Now seizing on the sword, and now the pen;<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">so that he still left a small collection of poems, which
the faithful widow of Boscan, finding among her husband’s papers,
published at the end of his works as a Fourth Book, and has thus
rescued what would otherwise probably have been lost. Their character
is singular, considering the circumstances under which they were
written; for, instead of betraying any of the spirit that governed the
main course of their author’s adventurous life and brought him to an
early grave, they are remarkable for their gentleness and melancholy,
and their best portions are in a pastoral tone breathing the very
sweetness of the fabulous ages of Arcadia. When he wrote most of them
we have no means of determining with exactness. But with the exception
of three or four trifles that appear mingled with other similar trifles
in the first book of Boscan’s works, all Garcilasso’s poems are in the
Italian forms, which we know were first adopted, with his coöperation,
in 1526; so that we must, at any rate, place them in the ten years
between this date and that of his death.</p>

<p>They consist of thirty-seven sonnets, five <i>canzones</i>, two elegies,
an epistle in <i>versi sciolti</i> less grave than the rest of his poetry,
and three pastorals; the pastorals constituting more than half of all
the verse he wrote. The air of the whole is Italian. He has imitated
Petrarch, Bembo, Ariosto, and especially Sannazaro, to whom he has
once or twice been indebted for pages together; turning, however,
from time to time, reverently to the greater ancient masters, Virgil
and Theocritus, and acknowledging their supremacy. Where the Italian
tone most prevails, something of the poetical spirit which<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[p. 491]</span> should sustain him is
lost. But, after all, Garcilasso was a poet of no common genius. We see
it sometimes even in the strictest of his imitations; but it reveals
itself much more distinctly when, as in the first Eclogue, he uses as
servants the masters to whom he elsewhere devotes himself, and writes
only like a Spaniard, warm with the peculiar national spirit of his
country.</p>

<p>This first Eclogue is, in truth, the best of his works. It is
beautiful in the simplicity of its structure, and beautiful in its
poetical execution. It was probably written at Naples. It opens with
an address to the father of the famous Duke of Alva, then viceroy
of that principality, calling upon him, in the most artless manner,
to listen to the complaints of two shepherds, the first mourning
the faithlessness of a mistress, and the other the death of one.
Salicio, who represents Garcilasso, then begins; and when he has
entirely finished, but not before, he is answered by Nemoroso,
whose name indicates that he represents Boscan.<a id="FNanchor_781"
href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The whole closes
naturally and gracefully with a description of the approach of evening.
It is, therefore, not properly a dialogue, any more than the eighth
Eclogue of Virgil. On the contrary, except the lines at the opening and
the conclusion, it might be regarded as two separate elegies, in which
the pastoral tone is uncommonly well preserved, and each of which,
by its divisions and arrangements, is made to resemble an Italian
<i>canzone</i>. An air of freshness and even originality is thus given to
the structure of the entire pastoral, while, at the same time, the
melancholy, but glowing, passion that breathes through it renders it in
a high degree poetical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[p. 492]</span>In the first
part, where Salicio laments the unfaithfulness of his mistress, there
is a happy preservation of the air of pastoral life by a constant, and
yet not forced, allusion to natural scenery and rural objects, as in
the following passage:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For thee, the silence of the shady wood</p>
<p class="i0">I loved; for thee, the secret mountain-top,</p>
<p class="i0">Which dwells apart, glad in its solitude;</p>
<p class="i0">For thee, I loved the verdant grass, the wind</p>
<p class="i0">That breathed so fresh and cool, the lily pale,</p>
<p class="i0">The blushing rose, and all the fragrant treasures</p>
<p class="i0">Of the opening spring! But, O! how far</p>
<p class="i0">From all I thought, from all I trusted, amidst</p>
<p class="i0">Loving scenes like these, was that dark falsehood</p>
<p class="i0">That lay hid within thy treacherous heart!<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>The other division of the Eclogue contains passages that remind us
both of Milton’s “Lycidas” and of the ancients whom Milton imitated.
Thus, in the following lines, where the opening idea is taken from
a well-known passage in the Odyssey, the conclusion is not unworthy
of the thought that precedes it, and adds a new charm to what so
many poets since Homer had rendered familiar:<a id="FNanchor_783"
href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And as the nightingale that hides herself</p>
<p class="i0">Amidst the sheltering leaves, and sorrows there,</p>
<p class="i0">Because the unfeeling hind, with cruel craft,</p>
<p class="i0">Hath stole away her unfledged offspring dear,—</p>
<p class="i0">Stole them from out the nest that was their home,</p>
<p class="i0">While she was absent from the bough she loved,—</p>
<p class="i0">And pours her grief in sweetest melody,</p>
<p class="i0">Filling the air with passionate complaint,</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[p. 493]</span>Amidst the silence of the gloomy night,</p>
<p class="i0">Calling on heaven and heaven’s pure stars</p>
<p class="i0">To witness her great wrong;—so I am yielded up</p>
<p class="i0">To misery, and mourn, in vain, that Death</p>
<p class="i0">Should thrust his hand into my inmost heart,</p>
<p class="i0">And bear away, as from its nest and home,</p>
<p class="i0">The love I cherished with unceasing care!<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Garcilasso’s versification is uncommonly sweet, and well suited to
the tender and sad character of his poetry. In his second Eclogue,
he has tried the singular experiment of making the rhyme often, not
between the ends of two lines, but between the end of one and the
middle of the next. It was not, however, successful. Cervantes has
imitated it, and so have one or two others; but wherever the rhyme is
quite obvious, the effect is not good, and where it is little noticed,
the lines take rather the character of blank verse.<a id="FNanchor_785"
href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> In general, however,
Garcilasso’s harmony can hardly be improved; at least, not without
injuring his versification in particulars yet more important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[p. 494]</span>His poems had
a great success from the moment they appeared. There was a grace
and an elegance about them of which Boscan may in part have set the
example, but which Boscan was never able to reach. The Spaniards who
came back from Rome and Naples were delighted to find at home what
had so much charmed them in their campaigns and wanderings in Italy;
and Garcilasso’s poems were proudly reprinted wherever the Spanish
arms and influence extended. They received, too, other honors. In less
than half a century from their first appearance, Francisco Sanchez,
commonly called “El Brocense,” the most learned Spaniard of his age,
added a commentary to them, which has still some value. A little
later, Herrera, the lyric poet, published them, with a series of notes
yet more ample, in which, amidst much that is useless, interesting
details may be found, for which he was indebted to Puerto Carrero, the
poet’s son-in-law. And early in the next century, Tamayo de Vargas
again encumbered the whole with a new mass of unprofitable learning.<a
id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Such
distinctions, however, constituted, even when they were fresh, little
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[p. 495]</span> Garcilasso’s
real glory, which rested on the safer foundations of a genuine and
general regard. His poetry, from the first, sunk deep into the hearts
of his countrymen. His sonnets were heard everywhere; his eclogues were
acted like popular dramas.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787"
class="fnanchor">[787]</a> The greatest geniuses of his nation express
for him a reverence they show to none of their predecessors. Lope de
Vega imitates him in every possible way; Cervantes praises him more
than he does any other poet, and cites him oftener.<a id="FNanchor_788"
href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> And thus Garcilasso
has come down to us enjoying a general national admiration, such as is
given to hardly any other Spanish poet, and to none that lived before
his time.</p>

<p>That it would have been better for himself and for the literature
of his country, if he had drawn more from the elements of the earlier
national character, and imitated less the great Italian masters he
justly admired, can hardly be doubted. It would have given a freer
and more generous movement to his poetical genius, and opened to
him a range of subjects and forms of composition, from which, by
rejecting the example of the national poets that had gone before
him, he excluded himself.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789"
class="fnanchor">[789]</a> But he deliberately decided otherwise;
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[p. 496]</span> his great
success, added to that of Boscan, introduced into Spain an Italian
school of poetry which has been an important part of Spanish
literature ever since.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790"

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> example set by Boscan and Garcilasso
was so well suited to the spirit and demands of the age, that it became
as much a fashion, at the court of Charles the Fifth, to write in the
Italian manner as it did to travel in Italy or make a military campaign
there. Among those who earliest adopted the forms of Italian verse
was Fernando de Acuña, a gentleman belonging to a noble Portuguese
family, but born in Madrid and writing only in Spanish. He served in
Flanders, in Italy, and in Africa; and after the conquest of Tunis,
in 1535, a mutiny having occurred in its garrison, he was sent there
by the Emperor, with unlimited authority to punish or to pardon those
implicated in it; a difficult mission, whose duties he fulfilled with
great discretion and with an honorable generosity.</p>

<p>In other respects, too, Acuña was treated with peculiar confidence.
Charles the Fifth—as we learn from the familiar correspondence
of Van Male, a poor scholar and gentleman who slept often in his
bed-chamber and nursed him in his infirmities—amused the fretfulness
of a premature old age, under which his proud spirit constantly
chafed, by making a translation into Spanish<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_498">[p. 498]</span> prose of a French poem then much in
vogue and favor,—the “Chevalier Délibéré.” Its author, Olivier de la
Marche, was long attached to the service of Mary of Burgundy, the
Emperor’s grandmother, and had made, in the Chevalier Délibéré, an
allegorical show of the events in the life of her father, so flattering
as to render his picture an object of general admiration at the time
when Charles was educated at her brilliant court.<a id="FNanchor_791"
href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> But the great Emperor,
though his prose version of the pleasant reading of his youth is said
to have been prepared with more skill and success than might have been
anticipated from his imperfect training for such a task, felt that
he was unable to give it the easy dress he desired it should wear
in Castilian verse. This labor, therefore, in the plenitude of his
authority, he assigned to Acuña; confiding to him the manuscript he had
prepared in great secrecy, and requiring him to cast it into a more
appropriate and agreeable form.</p>

<p>Acuña was well fitted for the delicate duty assigned to him.
As a courtier, skilled in the humors of the palace, he omitted
several passages that would be little interesting to his master, and
inserted others that would be more so,—particularly several relating
to Ferdinand and Isabella, and to Philip, Charles’s father. As a
poet, he turned the Emperor’s prose into the old double <i>quintillas</i>
with a purity and richness of idiom rare in any period of Spanish
literature, and some portion of the merit of which has, perhaps justly,
been attributed by Van Male to the Imperial version out of which it
was constructed. The poem thus prepared—making three hundred and
seventy-nine stanzas of ten short lines each—was then secretly given
by Charles, as if it were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[p.
499]</span> present worthy of a munificent sovereign, to Van Male,
the poor servant, who records the facts relating to it, and then,
forbidding all notice of himself in the Preface, the Emperor ordered
an edition of it, so large, that the unhappy scholar trembled at the
pecuniary risks he was to run on account of the bounty he had received.
The “Cavallero Determinado,” as it was called in the version of Acuña,
was, however, more successful than Van Male supposed it would be; and,
partly from the interest the master of so many kingdoms must have
felt in a work in which his secret share was considerable; partly
from the ingenuity of the allegory, which is due in general to La
Marche; and partly from the fluency and grace of the versification,
which must be wholly Acuña’s, it became very popular; seven
editions of it being called for in the course of half a century.<a
id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[p. 500]</span>But
notwithstanding the success of the Cavallero Determinado, Acuña wrote
hardly any thing else in the old national style and manner. His shorter
poems, filling a small volume, are, with one or two inconsiderable
exceptions, in the Italian measures, and sometimes are direct
imitations of Boscan and Garcilasso. They are almost all written in
good taste, and with a classical finish, especially “The Contest of
Ajax with Ulysses,” where, in tolerable blank verse, Acuña has imitated
the severe simplicity of Homer. He was known, too, in Italy, and his
translation of a part of Boiardo’s “Orlando Innamorato” was praised
there; but his miscellanies and his sonnets found more favor at home.
He died at Granada, it is said, in 1580, while prosecuting a claim he
had inherited to a Spanish title; but his poems were not printed till
1591, when, like those of Boscan, with which they may be fairly ranked,
they were published by the pious care of his widow.<a id="FNanchor_793"
href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>Less fortunate in this respect than Acuña was Gutierre de Cetina,
another Spaniard of the same period and school, since no attempt
has ever been made to collect his poems. The few that remain to
us, however,—his madrigals, sonnets, and other short pieces,—have
much merit. Sometimes they take an Anacreontic tone; but the better
specimens are rather marked by sweetness, like the following
madrigal:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[p. 501]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Eyes, that have still serenely shone,</p>
<p class="i2">And still for gentleness been praised,</p>
<p class="i2">Why thus in anger are ye raised,</p>
<p class="i0">When turned on me, and me alone?</p>
<p class="i2">The more ye tenderly and gently beam,</p>
<p class="i2">The more to all ye winning seem;—</p>
<p class="i0">But yet,—O, yet,—dear eyes, serene and sweet,</p>
<p class="i0">Turn on me still, whate’er the glance I meet!<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Like many others of his countrymen, Cetina was a soldier, and fought
bravely in Italy. Afterwards he visited Mexico, where he had a brother
in an important public office; but he died, at last, in Seville, his
native city, about the year 1560. He was an imitator of Garcilasso,
even more than of the Italians who were Garcilasso’s models.<a
id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<p>But an Italian school was not introduced into Spanish literature
without a contest. We cannot, perhaps, tell who first broke ground
against it, as an unprofitable and unjustifiable innovation; but
Christóval de Castillejo, a gentleman of Ciudad Rodrigo, was the most
efficient of its early opponents. He was attached, from the age of
fifteen, to the person of Ferdinand, the younger brother of Charles
the Fifth, and subsequently Emperor of Germany; passing a part of
his life in Austria, as secretary to that prince, and ending it, in
extreme old age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[p. 502]</span>
as a Carthusian monk, at the convent of Val de Iglesias, near Toledo.
But wherever he lived, Castillejo wrote verses, and showed no favor to
the new school. He attacked it in many ways, but chiefly by imitating
the old masters in their <i>villancicos</i>, <i>canciones</i>, <i>glosas</i>, and the
other forms and measures they adopted, though with a purer and better
taste than they had generally shown.</p>

<p>Some of his poetry was written as early as 1540 and 1541; and,
except the religious portion, which fills the latter part of the third
and last of the three books into which his works are divided, it has
generally a fresh and youthful air. Facility and gayety are, perhaps,
its most prominent, though certainly not its highest, characteristics.
Some of his love-verses are remarkable for their tenderness and grace,
especially those addressed to Anna; but he shows the force and bent of
his talent rather when he deals with practical life, as he does in his
bitter discussion concerning the court; in a dialogue between his pen
and himself; in a poem on Woman; and in a letter to a friend, asking
counsel about a love affair;—all of which are full of living sketches
of the national manners and feelings. Next to these, perhaps, some of
his more fanciful pieces, such as his “Transformation of a Drunkard
into a Mosquito,” are the most characteristic of his light-hearted
nature.</p>

<p>But on every occasion where he finds an opening, or can make one,
he attacks the imitators of the Italians, whom he contemptuously calls
“Petrarquistas.” Once, he devotes to them a regular satire, which he
addresses “to those who give up the Castilian measures and follow the
Italian,” calling out Boscan and Garcilasso by name, and summoning Juan
de Mena, Sanchez de Badajoz, Naharro, and others of the elder poets,
to make merry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[p. 503]</span> with
him, at the expense of the innovators. Almost everywhere he shows a
genial temperament, and sometimes indulges himself in a freer tone
than was thought beseeming at the time when he lived; in consequence
of which, his poetry, though much circulated in manuscript, was
forbidden by the Inquisition; so that all we now possess of it is
a selection, which, by a sort of special favor, was exempted from
censure, and permitted to be printed in 1573.<a id="FNanchor_796"
href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>Another of those who maintained the doctrines and wrote in the
measures of the old school was Antonio de Villegas, whose poems, though
written before 1551, were not printed till 1565. The Prólogo, addressed
to the book, with instructions how it should bear itself in the world,
reminds us sometimes of “The Soul’s Errand,” but is more easy and less
poetical. The best poems of the volume are, indeed, of this sort, light
and gay; rather running into pretty quaintnesses than giving token of
deep feeling. The longer among them, like those on Pyramus and Thisbe,
and on the quarrel between Ulysses and Ajax, are the least interesting.
But the shorter pieces are many of them very agreeable. One to the Duke
of Sesa, the descendant of Gonzalvo of Córdova, and addressed to him
as he was going to Italy, where Cervantes served under his leading,
is fortunate, from its allusion to his great ancestor. It begins
thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[p. 504]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Go forth to Italy, great chief;</p>
<p class="i2">It is thy fated land,</p>
<p class="i0">Sown thick with deeds of brave emprise</p>
<p class="i2">By that ancestral hand</p>
<p class="i0">Which cast its seeds so widely there,</p>
<p class="i2">That, as thou marchest on,</p>
<p class="i0">The very soil will start afresh,</p>
<p class="i2">Teeming with glories won;</p>
<p class="i0">While round thy form, like myriad suns,</p>
<p class="i2">Shall shine a halo’s flame,</p>
<p class="i0">Enkindled from the dazzling light</p>
<p class="i2">Of thy great father’s fame.</p>
</div></div>

<p>More characteristic than this, however, because less heroic
and grave, are eighteen <i>décimas</i>, or ten-line poems, called
“Comparaciones,” because each ends with a comparison; the whole being
preceded by a longer composition in the same style, addressing them
all to his lady-love. The following may serve as a specimen of their
peculiar tone and measure:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Lady! so used my soul is grown</p>
<p class="i2">To serve thee always in pure truth,</p>
<p class="i0">That, drawn to thee, and thee alone,</p>
<p class="i2">My joys come thronging; and my youth</p>
<p class="i0">No grief can jar, save when thou grievest its tone.</p>
<p class="i2">But though my faithful soul be thus in part</p>
<p class="i0">Untuned, when dissonance it feels in thee,</p>
<p class="i2">Still, still to thine turns back my trembling heart,</p>
<p class="i0">As jars the well-tuned string in sympathy</p>
<p class="i2">With that which trembles at the tuner’s art.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[p. 505]</span>Gregorio
Silvestre, a Portuguese, who came in his childhood to Spain, and
died there in 1570, was another of those who wrote according to the
earlier modes of composition. He was a friend of Torres de Naharro,
of Garci Sanchez de Badajoz, and of Heredia; and, for some time,
imitated Castillejo in speaking lightly of Boscan and Garcilasso. But,
as the Italian manner prevailed more and more, he yielded somewhat to
the fashion; and, in his latter years, wrote sonnets, and <i>ottava</i>
and <i>terza rima</i>, adding to their forms a careful finish not then
enough valued in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798"
class="fnanchor">[798]</a> All his poetry, notwithstanding the
accident of his foreign birth, is written in pure and idiomatic
Castilian; but the best of it is in the older style,—“the old rhymes,”
as he called them,—in which, apparently, he felt more freedom than
he did in the manner he subsequently adopted. His Glosses seem to
have been most regarded by himself and his friends; and if the
nature of the composition itself had been more elevated, they might
still deserve the praise they at first received, for he shows great
facility and ingenuity in their construction.<a id="FNanchor_799"
href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>His longer narrative poems—those on Daphne and Apollo, and on
Pyramus and Thisbe, as well as one he called “The Residence of
Love”—are not without merit, though they are among the less fortunate
of his efforts. But his <i>canciones</i> are to be ranked with the very
best in the language; full of the old true-hearted simplicity of
feeling, and yet not without an artifice in their turns of expression,
which, far from interfering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[p.
506]</span> with their point and effect, adds to both. Thus, one of
them begins:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Your locks are all of gold, my lady,</p>
<p class="i2">And of gold each priceless hair;</p>
<p class="i0">And the heart is all of steel, my lady,</p>
<p class="i2">That sees them without despair.</p>
</div></div>

<p>While a little farther on he gives to the same idea a quaint turn,
or answer, such as he delighted to make:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Not of gold would be your hair, dear lady,</p>
<p class="i2">No, not of gold so fair;</p>
<p class="i0">But the fine, rich gold itself, dear lady,</p>
<p class="i2">That gold would be your hair.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">Each is followed by a sort of gloss, or variation of the
original air, which again is not without its appropriate merit.</p>

<p>Silvestre was much connected with the poets of his time; not only
those of the old school, but those of the Italian, like Diego de
Mendoza, Hernando de Acuña, George of Montemayor, and Luis Barahona de
Soto. Their poems, in fact, are sometimes found mingled with his own,
and their spirit, we see, had a controlling influence over his. But
whether, in return, he produced much effect on them, or on his times,
may be doubted. He seems to have passed his life quietly in Granada,
of whose noble cathedral he was the principal musician, and where he
was much valued as a member of society, for his wit and kindly nature.
But when he died, at the age of fifty, his poetry was known only in
manuscript; and after it was collected and published by his friend
Pedro de Caceres, twelve years later, it produced little sensation. He
belonged, in truth, to both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[p.
507]</span> schools, and was therefore thoroughly admired by neither.<a
id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>The discussion between the two, however, soon became a formal
one. Argote de Molina naturally brought it into his Discourse on
Spanish Poetry in 1575,<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802"
class="fnanchor">[802]</a> and Montalvo introduced it into his
Pastoral, where it little belongs, but where, under assumed
names, Cervantes, Ercilla, Castillejo, Silvestre, and Montalvo<a
id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
himself, give their opinions in favor of the old school. This was in
1582. In 1599, Lope de Vega defended the same side in the Preface
to his “San Isidro.”<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804"
class="fnanchor">[804]</a> But the question was then substantially
decided. Five or six long epics, including the “Araucana,” had already
been written in the Italian <i>ottava rima</i>; as many pastorals, in
imitation of Sannazaro’s; and thousands of verses in the shape of
sonnets, <i>canzoni</i>, and the other forms of Italian poetry, a large
portion of which had found much favor. Even Lope de Vega, therefore,
who is quite decided in his opinion, and wrote his poem of “San
Isidro” in the old popular <i>redondillas</i>, fell in with the prevailing
fashion, so that, perhaps, in the end, nobody did more than himself to
confirm the Italian measures and manner. From this time, there<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[p. 508]</span>fore, the success of the
new school may be considered certain and settled; nor has it ever since
been displaced or superseded, as an important division of Spanish
literature.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> those who did most to decide the
question in favor of the introduction and establishment of the Italian
measures in Spanish literature was one whose rank and social position
gave him great authority, and whose genius, cultivation, and adventures
point alike to his connection with the period we have just gone over
and with that on which we are now entering. This person was Diego
Hurtado de Mendoza, a scholar and a soldier, a poet and a diplomatist,
a statesman and an historian,—a man who rose to great consideration in
whatever he undertook, and one who was not of a temper to be satisfied
with moderate success, wherever he might choose to make an effort.<a
id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>He was born in Granada in 1503, and his ancestry was perhaps the
most illustrious in Spain, if we except the descendants of those who
had sat on the thrones of its different kingdoms. Lope de Vega, who
turns aside in one of his plays to boast that it was so, adds, that,
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[p. 510]</span> his time,
the Mendozas counted three-and-twenty generations of the highest
nobility and public service.<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806"
class="fnanchor">[806]</a> But it is more important for our present
purpose to notice that the three immediate ancestors of the
distinguished statesman now before us might well have served as
examples to form his young character; for he was the third in direct
descent from the Marquis of Santillana, the poet and wit of the
court of John the Second; his grandfather was the able ambassador of
Ferdinand and Isabella, in their troublesome affairs with the See of
Rome; and his father, after commanding with distinguished honor in the
last great overthrow of the Moors, was made governor of the unquiet
city of Granada not long after its surrender.</p>

<p>Diego, however, had five brothers older than himself; and therefore,
notwithstanding the power of his family, he was originally destined for
the Church, in order to give him more easily the position and income
that should sustain his great name with becoming dignity. But his
character could not be bent in that direction. He acquired, indeed,
much knowledge suited to further his ecclesiastical advancement, both
at home, where he learned to speak the Arabic with fluency, and at
Sala<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[p. 511]</span>manca, where
he studied Latin, Greek, philosophy, and canon and civil law, with
success. But it is evident that he indulged a decided preference for
what was more intimately connected with political affairs and elegant
literature; and if, as is commonly supposed, he wrote while at the
University, or soon afterwards, his “Lazarillo de Tórmes,” it is
equally plain that he preferred such a literature as had no relation to
theology or the Church.</p>

<p>The Lazarillo is a work of genius, unlike any thing that had
preceded it. It is the autobiography of a boy—“little Lazarus”—born
in a mill on the banks of the Tórmes, near Salamanca, and sent out by
his base and brutal mother as the leader of a blind beggar; the lowest
place in the social condition, perhaps, that could then be found in
Spain. But such as it is, Lazarillo makes the best or the worst of it.
With an inexhaustible fund of good-humor and great quickness of parts,
he learns, at once, the cunning and profligacy that qualify him to
rise to still greater frauds and a yet wider range of adventures and
crimes in the service successively of a priest, a gentleman starving
on his own pride, a friar, a seller of indulgences, a chaplain, and an
alguazil, until, at last, from the most disgraceful motives, he settles
down as a married man; and then the story terminates without reaching
any proper conclusion, and without intimating that any is to follow.</p>

<p>Its object is—under the character of a servant with an acuteness
that is never at fault, and so small a stock of honesty and truth, that
neither of them stands in the way of his success—to give a pungent
satire on all classes of society, whose condition Lazarillo well
comprehends, because he sees them in undress and behind the scenes.
It is written in a very bold, rich, and idio<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_512">[p. 512]</span>matic Castilian style, that reminds us
of the “Celestina”; and some of its sketches are among the most fresh
and spirited that can be found in the whole class of prose works of
fiction; so spirited, indeed, and so free, that two of them—those of
the friar and the seller of dispensations—were soon put under the ban
of the Church, and cut out of the editions that were permitted to be
printed under its authority. The whole work is short; but its easy,
genial temper, its happy adaptation to Spanish life and manners,
and the contrast of the light, good-humored, flexible audacity of
Lazarillo himself—a perfectly original conception—with the solemn and
unyielding dignity of the old Castilian character, gave it from the
first a great popularity. From 1553, when the earliest edition appeared
of which we have any knowledge, it was often reprinted, both at home
and abroad, and has been more or less a favorite in all languages,
down to our own time; becoming the foundation for a class of fictions
essentially national, which, under the name of the <i>gusto picaresco</i>,
or the style of the rogues, is as well known as any other department of
Spanish literature, and one which the “Gil Blas” of Le Sage has made
famous throughout the world.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807"
class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>Like other books enjoying a wide reputation, the Lazarillo
provoked many imitations. A continuation of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_513">[p. 513]</span> it, under the title of “The Second Part
of Lazarillo de Tórmes,” soon appeared, longer than the original, and
beginning where the fiction of Mendoza leaves off. But it is without
merit, except for an occasional quaintness or witticism. It represents
Lazarillo as going upon the expedition undertaken by Charles the Fifth
against Algiers, in 1541, and as being in one of the vessels that
foundered in a storm, which did much towards disconcerting the whole
enterprise. From this point, however, Lazarillo’s story becomes a
tissue of absurdities. He sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and there
creeps into a cave, where he is metamorphosed into a tunny-fish; and
the greater part of the work consists of an account of his glory and
happiness in the kingdom of the tunnies. At last, he is caught in a
seine, and, in the agony of his fear of death, returns, by an effort
of his own will, to the human form; after which he finds his way
back to Salamanca, and is living there when he prepares this strange
account of his adventures.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808"
class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>A further imitation, but not a proper continuation, under the name
of “The Lazarillo of the Manzanares,” in which the state of society
at Madrid is satirized, was attempted by Juan Cortés de Tolosa, and
was first printed in 1620. But it produced no effect at the time, and
has been long forgotten. Nor was a much better fate reserved for yet
another Second Part of the genuine Lazarillo, which was written by Juan
de Luna, a teacher of Spanish at Paris, and appeared there the same
year the Lazarillo de Manzanares appeared at Madrid. It is, however,
more in the spirit of the original work. It exhibits Lazarillo again as
a servant to different kinds of masters, and as gentleman-usher of a
poor, proud lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[p. 514]</span> of
rank; after which he retires from the world, and, becoming a religious
recluse, writes this account of himself, which, though not equal to the
free and vigorous sketches of the work it professes to complete, is by
no means without value, especially for its style.<a id="FNanchor_809"
href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p>The author of the Lazarillo de Tórmes, who, we are told, took
the “Amadis” and the “Celestina” for his travelling companions
and by-reading,<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810"
class="fnanchor">[810]</a> was, as we have intimated, not a person to
devote himself to the Church; and we soon hear of him serving as a
soldier in the great Spanish armies in Italy; a circumstance to which,
in his old age, he alludes with evident pride and pleasure. At those
seasons, however, when the troops were unoccupied, we know that he
gladly listened to the lectures of the famous professors of Bologna,
Padua, and Rome, and added largely to his already large stores of
elegant knowledge.</p>

<p>A character so strongly marked would naturally attract the notice
of a monarch, vigilant and clear-sighted, like Charles the Fifth; and
as early as 1538, Mendoza was made his ambassador to the republic of
Venice, then one of the leading powers of Europe. But there, too,
though much busied with grave negotiations, he loved to be familiar
with men of letters. The Aldi were then at the height of their
reputation, and he assisted and patronized them. Paulus Manutius
dedicated to him an edition of the philosophical works of Cicero,
acknowledging his skill as a critic and praising his Latinity, though,
at the same time, he says that Mendoza rather exhorted the young to
study philosophy and science in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[p.
515]</span> their native languages;—a proof of liberality rare in
an age when the admiration for the ancients led a great number of
classical scholars to treat whatever was modern and vernacular with
contempt. At one period, he gave himself up to the pursuit of Greek and
Latin literature with a zeal such as Petrarch had shown long before
him. He sent to Thessaly and the famous convent of Mount Athos, to
collect Greek manuscripts. Josephus was first printed complete from
his library, and so were some of the Fathers of the Church. And when,
on one occasion, he had done so great a favor to the Sultan Soliman
that he was invited to demand any return from that monarch’s gratitude,
the only reward he would consent to receive for himself was a present
of some Greek manuscripts, which, as he said, amply repaid all his
services.</p>

<p>But, in the midst of studies so well suited to his taste and
character, the Emperor called him away to more important duties. He was
made military governor of Siena, and required to hold both the Pope and
the Florentines in check; a duty which he fulfilled, though not without
peril to his life. Somewhat later he was sent to the great Council of
Trent, known as a political no less than an ecclesiastical congress, in
order to sustain the Imperial interests there, and succeeded, by the
exercise of a degree of firmness, address, and eloquence which would
alone have made him one of the most considerable persons in the Spanish
monarchy. While at the Council, however, in consequence of the urgency
of affairs, he was despatched, as a special Imperial plenipotentiary
to Rome, in 1547, for the bold purpose of confronting and overawing
the Pope in his own capital. And in this, too, he succeeded; rebuking
Julius the Third in open council, and so establishing his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[p. 516]</span> own consideration, as
well as that of his country, that for six years afterwards he is to
be looked upon as the head of the Imperial party throughout Italy,
and almost as a viceroy governing that country, or a large part of
it, for the Emperor, by his talents and firmness. But at last he grew
weary of this great labor and burden; and the Emperor himself having
changed his system and determined to conciliate Europe before he should
abdicate, Mendoza returned to Spain in 1554.<a id="FNanchor_811"
href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>The next year, Philip the Second ascended the throne. His policy,
however, little resembled that of his father, and Mendoza was not
one of those who were well suited to the changed state of things.
In consequence of this, he seldom came to court, and was not at all
favored by the severe master who now ruled him, as he ruled all the
other great men of his kingdom, with a hard and anxious tyranny.<a
id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>
One instance of his displeasure against Mendoza, and of the harsh
treatment that followed it, is sufficiently remarkable. The ambassador,
who, though sixty-four years of age when the event occurred, had
lost little of the fire of his youth, fell into a passionate dispute
with a courtier in the palace itself. The latter drew a dagger, and
Mendoza wrested it from him and threw it out of the balcony where they
were standing;—some accounts adding, that he afterwards threw out
the courtier himself. Such a quarrel would certainly be accounted an
affront to the royal dignity anywhere; but in the eyes of the formal
and strict Philip the Sec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[p.
517]</span>ond it was all but a mortal offence. He chose to have
Mendoza regarded as a madman, and as such exiled him from his court;—an
injustice against which the old man struggled in vain for some time,
and then yielded himself up to it with loyal dignity.</p>

<p>His amusement during some portion of his exile was—singular as
it may seem in one so old—to write poetry.<a id="FNanchor_813"
href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> But the occupation had
long been familiar to him. In the first edition of the works of Boscan
we have an epistle from Mendoza to that poet, evidently written when
he was young; besides which, several of his shorter pieces contain
internal proof that they were composed in Italy. But, notwithstanding
he had been so long in Venice and Rome, and notwithstanding Boscan must
have been among his earliest friends, he does not belong entirely to
the Italian school of poetry; for, though he has often imitated and
fully sanctioned the Italian measures, he often gave himself up to the
old <i>redondillas</i> and <i>quintillas</i>, and to the national tone of feeling
and reflection appropriate to these ancient forms of Castilian verse.<a
id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>The truth is, Mendoza had studied the ancients with a zeal and
success that had so far imbued his mind with their character and
temper, as in some measure to keep out all undue modern influences.
The first part of the Epistle to Boscan, already alluded to, though
written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[p. 518]</span> in flowing
<i>terza rima</i>, sounds almost like a translation of the Epistle of
Horace to Numicius, and yet it is not even a servile imitation; while
the latter part is absolutely Spanish, and gives such a description
of domestic life as never entered the imagination of antiquity.<a
id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> The
Hymn in honor of Cardinal Espinosa, one of the most finished of his
poems, is said to have been written after five days’ constant reading
of Pindar, but is nevertheless full of the old Castilian spirit;<a
id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>
and his second <i>cancion</i>, though quite in the Italian measure, shows
the turns of Horace more than of Petrarch.<a id="FNanchor_817"
href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Still, it is not
to be concealed that Mendoza gave the decisive influence of his
example to the new forms introduced by Boscan and Garcilasso;—a
fact plain from the manner in which that example is appealed to by
many of the poets of his time, and especially by Gregorio Silvestre
and Christóval de Mesa.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818"
class="fnanchor">[818]</a> In both styles, however, he succeeded.
There is, perhaps, more richness of thought in the specimens he has
given us in the Italian measures than in the others; yet it can hardly
be doubted that his heart was in what he wrote upon the old popular
foundations. Some of his <i>letrillas</i>, as they would now be called,
though they bore different names in his time, are quite charming;<a
id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> and
in many parts of the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[p.
519]</span> division of his poems, which is larger than that devoted to
the Italian measures, there is a light and idle humor, well fitted to
his subjects, and such as might have been anticipated from the author
of the “Lazarillo” rather than from the Imperial representative at the
Council of Trent and the Papal court. Indeed, some of his verses were
so free, that it was thought inexpedient to print them.</p>

<p>The same spirit is apparent in two prose letters, or rather essays
thrown into the shape of letters. The first professes to come from a
person seeking employment at court, and gives an account of the whole
class of <i>Catariberas</i>, or low courtiers, who, in soiled clothes and
with base, fawning manners, daily besieged the doors and walks of the
President of the Council of Castile, in order to solicit some one of
the multitudinous humble offices in his gift. The other is addressed to
Pedro de Salazar, ridiculing a book he had published on the wars of the
Emperor in Germany, in which, as Mendoza declares, the author took more
credit to himself personally than he deserved. Both are written with
idiomatic humor, and a native buoyancy and gayety of spirit which seem
to have lain at the bottom of his character, and to have broken forth,
from time to time, during his whole life, notwithstanding the severe
employments which for so many years filled and burdened his thoughts.<a
id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p>The tendency of his mind, however, as he grew old,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[p. 520]</span> was naturally to graver
subjects; and finding there was no hope of his being recalled to
court, he established himself in unambitious retirement at Granada,
his native city. But his spirit was not one that would easily sink
into inactivity; and if it had been, he had not chosen a home that
would encourage such a disposition. For it was a spot, not only full
of romantic recollections, but intimately associated with the glory of
his own family,—one where he had spent much of his youth, and become
familiar with those remains and ruins of the Moorish power which bore
witness to days when the plain of Granada was the seat of one of
the most luxurious and splendid of the Mohammedan dynasties. Here,
therefore, he naturally turned to the early studies of his half-Arabian
education, and, arranging his library of curious Moorish manuscripts,
devoted himself to the literature and history of his native city,
until, at last, apparently from want of other occupation, he determined
to write a part of its annals.</p>

<p>The portion he chose was one very recent; that of the rebellion
raised by the Moors in 1568-1570, when they were no longer able to
endure the oppression of Philip the Second; and it is much to Mendoza’s
honor, that, with sympathies entirely Spanish, he has yet done the
hated enemies of his faith and people such generous justice, that his
book could not be published till many years after his own death,—not,
indeed, till the unhappy Moors themselves had been finally expelled
from Spain. His means for writing such a work were remarkable. His
father, as we have noticed, had been a general in the conquering
army of 1492, to which the story of this rebellion necessarily often
recurs, and had afterward been governor of Granada. One of his nephews
had commanded the troops in this very war. And<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_521">[p. 521]</span> now, after peace was restored by the
submission of the rebels, the old statesman, as he stood amidst the
trophies and ruins of the conflict, soon learned from eyewitnesses and
partisans whatever of interest had happened on either side that he
had not himself seen. Familiar, therefore, with every thing of which
he speaks, there is a freshness and power in his sketches that carry
us at once into the midst of the scenes and events he describes, and
make us sympathize in details too minute to be always interesting, if
they were not always marked with the impress of a living reality.<a
id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>But though his history springs, as it were, vigorously from the
very soil to which it relates, it is a sedulous and well-considered
imitation of the ancient masters, and entirely unlike the chronicling
spirit of the preceding period. The genius of antiquity, indeed, is
announced in its first sentence.</p>

<p>“My purpose,” says the old soldier, “is to record that war of
Granada which the Catholic King of Spain, Don Philip the Second, son
of the unconquered Emperor Don Charles, maintained in the kingdom of
Granada, against the newly converted rebels; a part whereof I saw, and
a part heard from persons who carried it on by their arms and by their
counsels.”</p>

<p>Sallust was undoubtedly Mendoza’s model. Like the War against
Catiline, the War of the Moorish Insurrection is a small work, and
like that, too, its style is generally rich and bold. But sometimes
long passages are evidently imitated from Tacitus, whose vigor and
severity the wise diplomatist seems to approach as nearly as he does
the more exuberant style of his prevalent master.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_522">[p. 522]</span> Some of these imitations are as happy,
perhaps, as any that can be produced from the class to which they
belong; for they are often no less unconstrained than if they were
quite original. Take, for instance, the following passage, which has
often been noticed for its spirit and feeling, but which is partly a
translation from the account given by Tacitus, in his most picturesque
and condensed manner, of the visit made by Germanicus and his army
to the spot where lay, unburied, the remains of the three legions of
Varus, in the forests of Germany, and of the funeral honors that army
paid to the memory of their fallen and almost forgotten countrymen;—the
circumstance described by the Spanish historian being so remarkably
similar to that given in the Annals of Tacitus, that the imitation
is perfectly natural.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822"
class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>During a rebellion of the Moors in 1500-1501, it was thought of
consequence to destroy a fort in the mountains that lay towards
Málaga. The service was dangerous, and none came forward to
undertake it, until Alonso de Aguilar, one of the principal nobles
in the service of Ferdinand and Isabella, offered himself for the
enterprise. His attempt, as had been foreseen, failed, and hardly a
man survived to relate the details of the disaster; but Aguilar’s
enthusiasm and self-devotion created a great sensation at the
time, and were afterwards recorded in more than one of the old
ballads of the country.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823"
class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>At the period, however, when Mendoza touches on this unhappy defeat,
nearly seventy years had elapsed, and the bones of both Spaniards and
Moors still lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[p. 523]</span>
whitening on the spot where they had fallen. The war between the
two races was again renewed by the insurrection of the conquered; a
military expedition was again undertaken into the same mountains; and
the Duke of Arcos, its leader, was a lineal descendant of some who had
fallen there, and intimately connected with the family of Alonso de
Aguilar himself. While, therefore, the troops for this expedition were
collecting, the Duke, from a natural curiosity and interest in what so
nearly concerned him, took a small body of soldiers and visited the
melancholy spot.</p>

<p>“The Duke left Casares,” says Mendoza, “examining and securing the
passes of the mountains as he went; a needful providence, on account of
the little certainty there is of success in all military adventures.
They then began to ascend the range of heights where it was said
the bodies had remained unburied, melancholy and loathsome alike to
the sight and the memory.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824"
class="fnanchor">[824]</a> For there were among those who now visited
it both kinsmen and descendants of the slain, or men who knew by
report whatever related to the sad scene. And first they came to the
spot where the vanguard had stopped with its leader, in consequence
of the darkness of the night; a broad opening between the foot of the
mountain and the Moorish fortress, without defence of any sort but such
as was afforded by the nature of the place. Here lay human skulls and
the bones of horses, heaped confusedly together or scattered about,
just as they had chanced to fall, mingled with fragments of arms and
bridles and the rich trappings of the cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_825"
href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Farther on, they
found the fort of the enemy, of which there<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_524">[p. 524]</span> were now only a few low remains, nearly
levelled with the surface of the soil. And then they went forward,
talking about the places where officers, leaders, and common soldiers
had perished together; relating how and where those who survived had
been saved, among whom were the Count of Ureña and Pedro de Aguilar,
elder son of Don Alonso; speaking of the spot where Don Alonso had
retired and defended himself between two rocks; the wound the Moorish
captain first gave him on the head, and then another in the breast
as he fell; the words he uttered as they closed in the fight, ‘I am
Don Alonso,’ and the answer of the chieftain as he struck him down,
‘You are Don Alonso, but I am the chieftain of Benastepár’; and of
the wounds Don Alonso gave, which were not fatal, as were those he
received. They remembered, too, how friends and enemies had alike
mourned his fate; and now, on that same spot, the same sorrow was
renewed by the soldiers,—a race sparing of its gratitude, except in
tears. The general commanded a service to be performed for the dead;
and the soldiers present offered up prayers that they might rest in
peace, uncertain whether they interceded for their kinsmen or for their
enemies,—a feeling which increased their rage and the eagerness they
felt for finding those upon whom they could now take vengeance.”<a
id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>There are several instances like this, in the course of the work,
that show how well pleased Mendoza was to step aside into an episode
and indulge himself in appropriate ornaments of his subject. The
main direction of his story, however, is never unnaturally deviated
from; and wherever he goes, he is almost always powerful and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[p. 525]</span> effective. Take, for
example, the following speech of El Zaguer, one of the principal
conspirators, exciting his countrymen to break out into open rebellion,
by exposing to them the long series of affronts and cruelties they had
suffered from their Spanish oppressors. It reminds us of the speeches
of the indignant Carthaginian leaders in Livy.</p>

<p>“Seeing,” says the historian, “that the greatness of the undertaking
brought with it hesitation, delays, and exposure to accident and change
of opinion, this conspirator collected the principal men together
in the house of Zinzan in the Albaycin, and addressed them, setting
forth the oppression they had constantly endured, at the hands both of
public officers and private persons, till they were become, he said,
no less slaves than if they had been formally made such,—their wives,
children, estates, and even their own persons, being in the power and
at the mercy of their enemies, without the hope of seeing themselves
freed from such servitude for centuries,—exposed to as many tyrants
as they had neighbours, and suffering constantly new impositions and
new taxes,—deprived of the right of sanctuary in places where those
take refuge who, through accident or (what is deemed among them the
more justifiable cause) through revenge, commit crime,—thrust out
from the protection of the very churches at whose religious rites we
are yet required, under severe penalties, to be present,—subjected to
the priests to enrich them, and yet held to be unworthy of favor from
God or men,—treated and regarded as Moors among Christians, that we
may be despised, and as Christians among Moors, that we may neither
be believed nor consoled. ‘They have excluded us, too,’ he went on,
‘from life and human intercourse; for they forbid us to speak our
own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[p. 526]</span> language, and
we do not understand theirs. In what way, then, are we to communicate
with others, or ask or give what life requires,—cut off from the
conversation of men, and denied what is not denied even to the brutes?
And yet may not he who speaks Castilian still hold to the law of the
Prophet, and may not he who speaks Moorish hold to the law of Jesus?
They force our children into their religious houses and schools, and
teach them arts which our fathers forbade us to learn, lest the purity
of our own law should be corrupted, and its very truth be made a
subject of doubt and quarrels. They threaten, too, to tear these our
children from the arms of their mothers and the protection of their
fathers, and send them into foreign lands, where they shall forget
our manners, and become the enemies of those to whom they owe their
existence. They command us to change our dress and wear clothes like
the Castilians. Yet among themselves the Germans dress in one fashion,
the French in another, and the Greeks in another; their friars, too,
and their young men, and their old men, have all separate costumes;
each nation, each profession, each class, has its own peculiar
dress, and still all are Christians;—while we—we Moors—are not to be
allowed to dress like Moors, as if we wore our faith in our raiment
and not in our hearts.’”<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827"
class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p>This is certainly picturesque; and so is the greater part of the
whole history, both from its subject and from the manner in which it
is treated. Nor is it lacking in dignity and elevation. Its style is
bold and abrupt, but true to the idiom of the language; and the current
of thought is deep and strong, easily carrying the reader onward
with its flood. Nothing in the old chronicling<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_527">[p. 527]</span> style of the earlier period is to be
compared to it, and little in any subsequent period is equal to it for
manliness, vigor, and truth.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828"
class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>The War of Granada is the last literary labor its author undertook.
He was, indeed, above seventy years old when he finished it; and,
perhaps to signify that he now renounced the career of letters, he
collected his library, both the classics and manuscripts he had
procured with so much trouble in Italy and Greece, and the curious
Arabic works he had found in Granada, and presented the whole to his
severe sovereign for his favorite establishment of the Escurial,
among whose untold treasures they still hold a prominent place. At
any rate, after this, we hear nothing of the old statesman, except
that, for some reason or other, Philip the Second permitted him to
come to court again; and that, a few days after he arrived at Madrid,
he was seized with a violent illness, of which he died in April,
1575, seventy-two years old.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829"
class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>On whatever side we regard the character of Mendoza, we feel
sure that he was an extraordinary man; but<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_528">[p. 528]</span> the combination of his powers is, after
all, what is most to be wondered at. In all of them, however, and
especially in the union of a life of military adventure and active
interest in affairs with a sincere love of learning and elegant
letters, he showed himself to be a genuine Spaniard;—the elements of
greatness which his various fortunes had thus unfolded within him being
all among the elements of Spanish national poetry and eloquence, in
their best age and most generous development. The loyal old knight,
therefore, may well stand forward with those who, first in the order
of time, as well as of merit, are to constitute that final school of
Spanish literature which was built on the safe foundations of the
national genius and character, and can, therefore, never be shaken by
the floods or convulsions of the ages that may come after it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> an Italian spirit, or, at least, an
observance of Italian forms, was beginning so decidedly to prevail in
Spanish lyric and pastoral poetry, what was didactic, whether in prose
or verse, took directions somewhat different.</p>

<p>In didactic poetry, among other forms, the old one of question
and answer, known from the age of Juan de Mena, and found in the
Cancioneros as late as Badajoz, continued to enjoy much favor.
Originally, such questions seem to have been riddles and witticisms;
but in the sixteenth century they gradually assumed a graver
character, and at last claimed to be directly and absolutely didactic,
constituting a form in which two remarkable books of light and easy
verse were produced. The first of these books is called “The Four
Hundred Answers to as many Questions of the Illustrious Don Fadrique
Enriquez, the Admiral of Castile, and other Persons.” It was printed
three times in 1545, the year in which it first appeared, and had
undoubtedly a great success in the class of society to which it
was addressed, and whose manners and opin<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_530">[p. 530]</span>ions it strikingly illustrates. It
contains at least twenty thousand verses, and was followed, in 1552, by
another similar volume, partly in prose, and promising a third, which,
however, was never published. Except five hundred proverbs, as they
are inappropriately called, at the end of the first volume, and fifty
glosses at the end of the second, the whole consists of such ingenious
questions as a distinguished old nobleman in the reign of Charles the
Fifth and his friends might imagine it would amuse or instruct them to
have solved. They are on subjects as various as possible,—religion,
morals, history, medicine, magic,—in short, whatever could occur
to idle and curious minds; but they were all sent to an acute,
good-humored Minorite friar, Luis de Escobar, who, being bed-ridden
with the gout and other grievous maladies, had nothing better to do
than to answer them.</p>

<p>His answers form the body of the work. Some of them are wise and
some foolish, some are learned and some absurd; but they all bear the
impression of their age. Once we have a long letter of advice about a
godly life, sent to the Admiral, which, no doubt, was well suited to
his case; and repeatedly we get complaints from the old monk himself
of his sufferings, and accounts of what he was doing; so that from
different parts of the two volumes it would be possible to collect a
tolerably distinct picture of the amusements of society, if not its
occupations, about the court, at the period when they were written.
The poetry is in many respects not unlike that of Tusser, who was
contemporary with Escobar, but it is better and more spirited.<a
id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[p. 531]</span>The second book
of questions and answers to which we have referred is graver than
the first. It was printed the next year after the great success of
Escobar’s work, and is called “Three Hundred Questions concerning
Natural Subjects, with their Answers,” by Alonso Lopez de Corelas,
a physician, who had more learning, perhaps, than the monk he
imitated, but is less amusing, and writes in verses neither so well
constructed nor so agreeable.<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831"
class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>Others followed, like Gonzalez de la Torre, who in 1590 dedicated
to the heir-apparent of the Spanish throne a volume of such dull
religious riddles as were admired a century before.<a id="FNanchor_832"
href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> But nobody, who wrote
in this peculiar didactic style of verse, equalled Escobar, and it
soon passed out of general notice and regard.<a id="FNanchor_833"
href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>In prose, about the same time, a fashion appeared of imitating
the Roman didactic prose-writers, just as those writers had been
imitated by Castiglione, Bembo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[p.
532]</span> Giovanni della Casa, and others in Italy. The impulse
seems plainly to have been communicated to Spain by the moderns,
and not by the ancients. It was because the Italians led the way
that the Romans were imitated, and not because the example of Cicero
and Seneca had, of itself, been able to form a prose school, of any
kind, beyond the Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834"
class="fnanchor">[834]</a> The fashion was not one of so much
importance and influence as that introduced into the poetry of the
nation; but it is worthy of notice, both on account of its results
during the reign of Charles the Fifth, and on account of an effect
more or less distinct which it had on the prose style of the nation
afterwards.</p>

<p>The eldest among the prominent writers produced by this state
of things was Francisco de Villalobos, of whom we know little,
except that he belonged to a family which, for several successive
generations, had been devoted to the medical art; that he was himself
the physician, first of Ferdinand the Catholic,<a id="FNanchor_835"
href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> and then of Charles
the Fifth; that he published, as early as 1498, a poem on his own
science, in five hundred stanzas, founded on the rules of Avicenna;<a
id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
and that he continued to be known as an author, chiefly on subjects
connected with his profession, till 1543, before which time he had
become weary of the court, and sought a volun<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_533">[p. 533]</span>tary retirement, where he died,
above seventy years old.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837"
class="fnanchor">[837]</a> His translation of the “Amphitryon” of
Plautus belongs rather to the theatre, but, like that of Oliva, soon
to be mentioned, produced no effect there, and, like his scientific
treatises, demands no especial notice. The rest of his works, including
all that belong to the department of elegant literature, are to be
found in a volume of moderate size, which he dedicated to the Infante
Don Luis of Portugal.</p>

<p>The chief of them is called “Problems,” and is divided into two
tractates;—the first, which is very short, being on the Sun, the
Planets, the Four Elements, and the Terrestrial Paradise; and the last,
which is longer, on Man and Morals, beginning with an essay on Satan,
and ending with one on Flattery and Flatterers, which is especially
addressed to the heir-apparent of the crown of Spain, afterwards Philip
the Second. Each of these subdivisions, in each tractate, has eight
lines of the old Spanish verse prefixed to it, as its Problem, or text,
and the prose discussion which follows, like a gloss, constitutes
the substance of the work. The whole is of a very miscellaneous
character; most of it grave, like the essays on Knights and Prelates,
but some of it amusing, like an essay on the Marriage of Old Men.<a
id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> The
best portions are those that have a satirical vein in them; such as
the ridicule of litigious old men, and of old men that wear paint.<a
id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[p. 534]</span>A Dialogue on
Intermittent Fevers, a Dialogue on the Natural Heat of the Body, and a
Dialogue between the Doctor and the Duke, his patient, are all quite in
the manner of the contemporary didactic discussions of the Italians,
except that the last contains passages of a broad and free humor,
approaching more nearly to the tone of comedy, or rather of farce.<a
id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>
A treatise that follows, on the Three Great Annoyances of much
talking, much disputing, and much laughing,<a id="FNanchor_841"
href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> and a grave discourse
on Love, with which the volume ends, are all that remain worth notice.
They have the same general characteristics with the rest of his
miscellanies; the style of some portions of them being distinguished by
more purity and more pretensions to dignity than have been found in the
earlier didactic prose-writers, and especially by greater clearness and
exactness of expression. Occasionally, too, we meet with an idiomatic
familiarity, frankness, and spirit that are very attractive, and that
partly compensate us for the absurdities of the old and forgotten
doctrines in natural history and medicine, which Villalobos inculcated
because they were the received doctrines of his time.</p>

<p>The next writer of the same class, and, on the whole, one much more
worthy of consideration, is Fernan Perez de Oliva, a Cordovese, who was
born about 1492, and died, still young, in 1530. His father was a lover
of letters; and the son, as he himself informs us, was educated with
care from his earliest youth. At twelve years of age, he was already a
student in the University of Salamanca; after which he went, first, to
Alcalá, when it was in the beginning of its glory; then to Paris,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[p. 535]</span> whose University had
long attracted students from every part of Europe; and finally to
Rome, where, under the protection of an uncle at the court of Leo the
Tenth, all the advantages to be found in the most cultivated capital of
Christendom were accessible to him.</p>

<p>On his uncle’s death, it was proposed to him to take the offices
left vacant by that event; but, loving letters more than courtly
honors, he went back to Paris, where he taught and lectured in its
University for three years. Another Pope, Adrian the Sixth, was now on
the throne, and, hearing of Oliva’s success, endeavoured anew to draw
him to Rome; but the love of his country and of literature continued to
be stronger than the love of ecclesiastical preferment. He returned,
therefore, to Salamanca; became one of the original members of the rich
“College of the Archbishop,” founded in 1528; and was successively
chosen Professor of Ethics in the University, and its Rector. But he
had hardly risen to his highest distinctions, when he died suddenly,
and at a moment when so many hopes rested on him, that his death was
felt as a misfortune to the cause of letters throughout Spain.<a
id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>Oliva’s studies at Rome had taught him how successfully the Latin
writers had been imitated by the Italians, and he became anxious
that they should be no less successfully imitated by the Spaniards.
He felt it as a wrong done to his native language, that almost all
serious prose discussions in Spain were still carried on in Latin
rather than in Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843"
class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Taking a hint, then,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_536">[p. 536]</span> from Castiglione’s “Cortigiano,” and
opposing the current of opinion among the learned men with whom he
lived and acted, he began a didactic dialogue on the Dignity of Man,
formally defending it as a work in the Spanish language written
by a Spaniard. Besides this, he wrote several strictly didactic
discourses;—one on the Faculties of the Mind and their Proper Use;
another urging Córdova, his native city, to improve the navigation of
the Guadalquivir, and so obtain a portion of the rich commerce of the
Indies, which was then monopolized by Seville; and another, that was
delivered at Salamanca, when he was a candidate for the chair of moral
philosophy;—in all which his nephew, Morales, the historian, assures
us it was his uncle’s strong desire to furnish practical examples of
the power and resources of the Spanish language.<a id="FNanchor_844"
href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>The purpose of giving greater dignity to his native tongue, by
employing it, instead of the Latin, on all the chief subjects of
human inquiry, was certainly a fortunate one in Oliva, and soon found
imitators. Juan de Sedeño published, in 1536, two prose dialogues
on Love and one on Happiness; the former in a more graceful tone of
gallantry, and the latter in a more philosophical spirit and with more
terseness of manner, than belonged to the age.<a id="FNanchor_845"
href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> Francisco Cervantes
de Salazar, a man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[p.
537]</span> learning, completed the dialogue of Oliva on the
Dignity of Man, which had been left unfinished, and, dedicating
it to Fernando Cortés, published it in 1546,<a id="FNanchor_846"
href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> together with a long
prose fable by Luis Mexia, on Idleness and Labor, written in a pure
and somewhat elevated style, but too much indebted to the “Vision” of
the Bachiller de la Torre.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847"
class="fnanchor">[847]</a> Pedro de Navarra published, in 1567,
forty Moral Dialogues, partly the result of conversations held in an
<i>Academia</i> of distinguished persons, who met, from time to time, at
the house of Fernando Cortés.<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848"
class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Pedro Mexia, the chronicler, wrote a Silva,
or Miscellany, divided, in the later editions, into six books, and
subdivided into a multitude of separate essays, historical and moral;
declaring it to be the first work of the kind<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_538">[p. 538]</span> in Spanish, which, he says, he
considers quite as suitable for such discussions as the Italian.<a
id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
To this, which may be regarded as an imitation of Macrobius or of
Athenæus, and which was printed in 1543, he added, in 1547, six
didactic dialogues,—curious, but of little value,—in the first of
which the advantages and disadvantages of having regular physicians
are agreeably set forth, with a lightness and exactness of style
hardly to have been expected.<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850"
class="fnanchor">[850]</a> And finally, to complete the short list,
Urrea, a favored soldier of the Emperor, and at one time viceroy of
Apulia,—the same person who made the poor translation of Ariosto
mentioned in Don Quixote,—published, in 1566, a Dialogue on True
Military Honor, which is written in a pleasant and easy style,
and contains, mingled with the notions of one who says he trained
himself for glory by reading romances of chivalry, not a few amusing
anecdotes of duels and military adventures.<a id="FNanchor_851"
href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[p. 539]</span>Both of the
works of Pedro Mexia, but especially his Silva, enjoyed no little
popularity during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and, in
point of style, they are certainly not without merit. None, however, of
the productions of any one of the authors last mentioned had so much
force and character as the first part of the Dialogue on the Dignity
of Man. And yet Oliva was certainly not a person of a commanding
genius. His imagination never warms into poetry; his invention is never
sufficient to give new and strong views to his subject; and his system
of imitating both the Latin and the Italian masters rather tends to
debilitate than to impart vigor to his thoughts. But there is a general
reasonableness and wisdom in what he says that win and often satisfy
us, and these, with his style, which, though sometimes declamatory,
is yet, on the whole, pure and well settled, and his happy idea of
defending and employing the Castilian, then coming into all its rights
as a living language, have had the effect of giving him a more lasting
reputation than that of any other Spanish prose-writer of his time.<a
id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>The same general tendency to a more formal and elegant style of
discussion is found in a few other ethical and religious authors
of the reign of Charles the Fifth that are still remembered; such
as Palacios Rubios, who wrote an essay on Military Courage, for
the benefit of his son;<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853"
class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Vanegas, who, under the title of “The<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[p. 540]</span> Agony of Passing
through Death,” gives us what may rather be considered an ascetic
treatise on holy living;<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854"
class="fnanchor">[854]</a> and Juan de Avila, sometimes called the
Apostle of Andalusia, whose letters are fervent exhortations to virtue
and religion, composed with care and often with eloquence, if not
with entire purity of style.<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855"
class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p>The author in this class, however, who during his lifetime had
the most influence was Antonio de Guevara, one of the official
chroniclers of Charles the Fifth. He was a Biscayan by birth, and
passed some of his earlier years at the court of Queen Isabella. In
1528 he became a Franciscan monk, but, enjoying the favor of the
Emperor, he seems to have been transformed into a thorough courtier,
accompanying his master during his journeys and residences in Italy
and other parts of Europe, and rising successively, by the royal
patronage, to be court preacher, Imperial historiographer, Bishop<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[p. 541]</span> of Guadix, and Bishop of
Mondoñedo. He died in 1545.<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856"
class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>His works were not numerous, but they were fitted to the atmosphere
in which they were produced and enjoyed at once a great popularity. His
“Dial for Princes, or Marcus Aurelius,” first published in 1529, and
the fruit, as he tells us, of eleven years’ labor,<a id="FNanchor_857"
href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> was not only often
reprinted in Spanish, but was translated into Latin, Italian, French,
and English; in each of which last two languages it appeared many times
before the end of the century.<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858"
class="fnanchor">[858]</a> It is a kind of romance, founded on the
life and character of Marcus Aurelius, and resembles, in some points,
the “Cyropædia” of Xenophon; its purpose being to place before the
Emperor Charles the Fifth the model of a prince more perfect for
wisdom and virtue than any other of antiquity. But the Bishop of
Mondoñedo adventured beyond his prerogative. He pretended that his
Marcus Aurelius was genuine history, and appealed to a manuscript in
Florence, which did not exist, as if he had done little more than make
a translation of it. In consequence of this, Pedro de Rua, a professor
of elegant literature in the college at Soria, addressed a letter to
him, in 1540, exposing the fraud. Two other letters followed, written
with more freedom and purity of style than any thing in the works of
the Bishop himself, and leaving him no real ground on which to stand.<a
id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> He,
however, defended himself as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[p.
542]</span> well as he was able; at first cautiously, but afterwards,
when he was more closely assailed, by assuming the wholly untenable
position, that all ancient profane history was no more true than his
romance of Marcus Aurelius, and that he had as good a right to invent
for his own high purposes as Herodotus or Livy. From this time he was
severely attacked; more so, perhaps, than he would have been, if the
gross frauds of Annius of Viterbo had not then been recent. But however
this may be, it was done with a bitterness that forms a strong contrast
to the applause bestowed in France, near the end of the eighteenth
century, upon a somewhat similar work on the same subject by Thomas.<a
id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>After all, however, the “Dial for Princes” is little worthy of
the excitement it occasioned. It is filled with letters and speeches
ill conceived and inappropriate; and is written in a formal and
inflated style. Perhaps we are now indebted to it for nothing so
much as for the beautiful fable of “The Peasant of the Danube,”
evidently suggested to La Fontaine by one of the discourses through
which Guevara endeavoured to give life and reality to his fictions.<a
id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[p. 543]</span>In the same
spirit, though with less boldness, he wrote his “Lives of the Ten Roman
Emperors”; a work which, like his Dial for Princes, he dedicated to
Charles the Fifth. In general, he has here followed the authorities
on which he claims to found his narrative, such as Dion Cassius and
the minor Latin historians, showing, at the same time, a marked
desire to imitate Plutarch and Suetonius, whom he announces as his
models. But he has not been able entirely to resist the temptation of
inserting fictitious letters, and even unfounded stories; thus giving
a false view, if not of the facts of history, at least of some of
the characters he records. His style, however, though it still wants
purity and appropriateness, is better and more simple than it is in his
romance on Marcus Aurelius.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862"
class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<p>Similar characteristics mark a large collection of Letters printed
by him as early as 1539. Many of them are addressed to persons of great
consideration in his time, such as the Marquis of Pescara, the Duke
of Alva, Iñigo de Velasco, Grand Constable of Castile, and Fadrique
Enriquez, Grand Admiral. But some were evidently never sent to the
persons addressed, like the loyal one to Juan de Padilla, the head
of the <i>Comuneros</i>, and two impertinent letters to the Governor Luis
Bravo, who had foolishly fallen in love in his old age. Others are
mere fictions; among which are a correspondence<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_544">[p. 544]</span> of the Emperor Trajan with Plutarch and
the Roman Senate, which Guevara vainly protests he translated from the
Greek, without saying where he found the originals,<a id="FNanchor_863"
href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> and a long epistle
about Laïs and other courtesans of antiquity, in which he gives the
details of their conversations as if he had listened to them himself.
Most of the letters, though they are called “Familiar Epistles,” are
merely essays or disputations, and a few are sermons in form, with an
announcement of the occasions on which they were preached. None has
the easy or natural air of a real correspondence. In fact, they were
all, no doubt, prepared expressly for publication and for effect; and,
notwithstanding their stiffness and formality, were greatly admired.
They were often printed in Spain; they were translated into all the
principal languages of Europe; and, to express the value set on them,
they were generally called “The Golden Epistles.” But notwithstanding
their early success, they have long been disregarded, and only a
few passages that touch the affairs of the time or the life of the
Emperor can now be read with interest or pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_864"
href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p>

<p>Besides these works, Guevara wrote several formal treatises. Two
are strictly theological.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865"
class="fnanchor">[865]</a> Another is on the Inventors of the Art of
Navigation and its Practice;—a subject which might be thought foreign
from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[p. 545]</span> Bishop’s
experience, but with which, he tells us, he had become familiar by
having been much at sea, and visited many ports on the Mediterranean.<a
id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> Of
his two other treatises, which are all that remain to be noticed, one
is called “Contempt of Court Life and Praise of the Country”; and the
other, “Counsels for Favorites, and Teachings for Courtiers.” They are
moral discussions, suggested by Castiglione’s “Courtier,” then at the
height of its popularity, and are written with great elaborateness,
in a solemn and stiff style, bearing the same relations to truth and
wisdom that Arcadian pastorals do to nature.<a id="FNanchor_867"
href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a></p>

<p>All the works of Guevara show the impress of their age, and mark
their author’s position at court. They are burdened with learning, yet
not without proofs of experience in the ways of the world;—they often
show good sense, but they are monotonous from the stately dignity
he thinks it necessary to assume on his own account, and from the
rhetorical ornament by which he hopes to commend them to the regard of
his readers. Such as they are, however, they illustrate and exemplify,
more truly, perhaps, than any thing else of their age, the style of
writing most in favor at the court of Charles the Fifth, especially
during the latter part of that monarch’s reign.</p>

<p>But by far the best didactic prose work of this period, though
unknown and unpublished till two centuries afterwards, is that commonly
cited under the simple title<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[p.
546]</span> of “The Dialogue on Languages”;—a work which, at any time,
would be deemed remarkable for the naturalness and purity of its style,
and is peculiarly so at this period of formal and elaborate eloquence.
“I write,” says its author, “as I speak; only I take more pains to
think what I have to say, and then I say it as simply as I can; for,
to my mind, affectation is out of place in all languages.” Who it was
that entertained an opinion so true, but in his time so uncommon, is
not certain. Probably it was Juan Valdés, a person who enjoys the
distinction of being one of the first Spaniards that embraced the
opinions of the Reformation, and the very first who made an effort to
spread them. He was educated at the University of Alcalá, and during
a part of his life possessed not a little political consequence,
being much about the person of the Emperor, and sent by him to act as
secretary and adviser to Toledo, the great viceroy of Naples. It is not
known what became of him afterwards; but he died in 1540, six years
before Charles the Fifth attempted to establish the Inquisition in
Naples; and therefore it is not likely that he was seriously molested
while he was in office there.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868"
class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>The Dialogue on Languages is supposed to be carried on between
two Spaniards and two Italians, at a country-house on the sea-shore,
near Naples, and is an acute discussion on the origin and character
of the Castilian. Parts of it are learned, but in these the author
sometimes falls into errors;<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869"
class="fnanchor">[869]</a> other parts are lively and enter<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[p. 547]</span>taining; and yet others
are full of good sense and sound criticism. The principal personage—the
one who gives all the instructions and explanations—is named Valdés;
and from this circumstance, as well as from some intimations in
the Dialogue itself, it may be inferred that the reformer was its
author, and that it was written before 1536;<a id="FNanchor_870"
href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>—a point which, if
established, would account for the suppression of the manuscript, as
the work of an adherent of Luther. In any event, the Dialogue was
not printed till 1737, and therefore, as a specimen of pure and easy
style, was lost on the age that produced it.<a id="FNanchor_871"
href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>For us it is important, because it shows, with more distinctness
than any other literary monument of its time, what was the state of
the Spanish language in the reign of the Emperor Charles the Fifth; a
circumstance of consequence to the condition of the literature, and one
to which we therefore turn with interest.</p>

<p>As might be expected, we find, when we look back, that the language
of letters in Spain has made material progress since we last noticed
it in the reign of John the Second. The example of Juan de Mena had
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[p. 548]</span> followed, and
the national vocabulary enriched during the interval of a century,
by successive poets, from the languages of classical antiquity.
From other sources, too, and through other channels, important
contributions had flowed in. From America and its commerce had come
the names of those productions which half a century of intercourse
had brought to Spain, and rendered familiar there,—terms few, indeed,
in number, but of daily use.<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872"
class="fnanchor">[872]</a> From Germany and the Low Countries still
more had been introduced by the accession of Charles the Fifth,<a
id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>
who, to the great annoyance of his Spanish subjects, arrived in
Spain surrounded by foreign courtiers, and speaking with a stranger
accent the language of the country he was called to govern.<a
id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> A few
words, too, had come accidentally from France; and now, in the reign of
Philip the Second, a great number, amounting to the most considerable
infusion the language had received since the time of the Arabs, were
brought in through the intimate connection of Spain with Italy and
the increasing influence of Italian letters and Italian culture.<a
id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>We may therefore consider that the Spanish language at this period
was not only formed, but that it had reached substantially its full
proportions, and had re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[p.
549]</span>ceived all its essential characteristics. Indeed, it had
already for half a century been regularly cared for and cultivated.
Alonso de Palencia, who had long been in the service of his country
as an ambassador, and was afterwards its chronicler, published a
Latin and Spanish Dictionary in 1490; the oldest in which a Castilian
vocabulary is to be found.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876"
class="fnanchor">[876]</a> This was succeeded, two years later, by
the first Castilian Grammar, the work of Antonio de Lebrixa, who had
before published a Latin Grammar in the Latin language, and translated
it for the benefit, as he tells us, of the ladies of the court.<a
id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>
Other similar and equally successful attempts followed. A purely
Spanish Dictionary by Lebrixa, the first of its kind, appeared
in 1492, and a Dictionary for ecclesiastical purposes, in both
Latin and Spanish, by Santa Ella, succeeded it in 1499; both often
reprinted afterwards, and long regarded as standard authorities.<a
id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
All these works, so important for the consolidation of the language,
and so well constructed that successors to them were not found till
above a century later,<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879"
class="fnanchor">[879]</a> were, it should be observed, produced under
the direct and personal patronage of Queen Isabella, who in this,
as in so many other ways, gave proof at once of her far-sightedness
in affairs of state, and of her wise tastes and preferences in
whatever regarded the intellectual cultivation of her subjects.<a
id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[p. 550]</span>The language
thus formed was now fast spreading throughout the kingdom, and
displacing dialects some of which, as old as itself, had seemed, at one
period, destined to surpass it in cultivation and general prevalence.
The ancient Galician, in which Alfonso the Wise was educated, and in
which he sometimes wrote, was now known as a polite language only
in Portugal, where it had risen to be so independent of the stock
from which it sprang as almost to disavow its origin. The Valencian
and Catalonian, those kindred dialects of the Provençal race, whose
influences in the thirteenth century were felt through the whole
Peninsula, claimed, at this period, something of their earlier dignity
only below the last range of hills on the coast of the Mediterranean.
The Biscayan alone, unchanged as the mountains which sheltered it,
still preserved for itself the same separate character it had at
the earliest dawnings of tradition,—a character which has continued
essentially the same down to our own times.</p>

<p>But though the Castilian, advancing with the whole authority of the
government, which at this time spoke to the people of all Spain in no
other language, was heard and acknowledged throughout the country as
the language of the state and of all political power, still the popular
and local habits of four centuries could not be at once or entirely
broken up. The Galician, the Valencian, and the Catalonian continued to
be spoken in the age of Charles the Fifth, and are spoken now by the
masses of the people in their respective provinces, and to some extent
in the refined society of each. Even Andalusia and Aragon have not yet
emancipated themselves completely from their original idioms; and in
the same way, each of the other grand divisions of the country, several
of which were at one time independent king<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_551">[p. 551]</span>doms, are still, like Estremadura and La
Mancha, distinguished by peculiarities of phraseology and accent.<a
id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>Castile alone, and especially Old Castile, claims, as of inherited
right, from the beginning of the fifteenth century, the prerogative
of speaking absolutely pure Spanish. Villalobos, it is true, who
was always a flatterer of royal authority, insisted that this
prerogative followed the residences of the sovereign and the court;<a
id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>
but the better opinion has been, that the purest form of the
Castilian must be sought at Toledo,—the Imperial Toledo, as it
was called,—peculiarly favored when it was the political capital
of the ancient monarchy in the time of the Goths, and consecrated
anew as the ecclesiastical head of all Christian Spain, the moment
it was rescued from the hands of the Moors.<a id="FNanchor_883"
href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> It has even been
said, that the supremacy of this venerable city in the purity of
its dialect was so fully settled, from the first appearance of the
language as the language of the state in the thirteenth century, that
Alfonso the Wise, in a Cortes held there, directed the meaning of any
disputed word to be settled by its use at Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_884"
href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> But however this may
be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[p. 552]</span> there is no
question, that, from the time of Charles the Fifth to the present day,
the Toledan has been considered, on the whole, the normal form of
the national language, and that, from the same period, the Castilian
dialect, having vindicated for itself an absolute supremacy over all
the other dialects of the monarchy, has been the only one recognized as
the language of the classical poetry and prose of the whole country.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of the sixteenth
century, it is obvious that the age for chronicles had gone by in
Spain. Still it was thought for the dignity of the monarchy that
the stately forms of the elder time should, in this as in other
particulars, be kept up by public authority. Charles the Fifth,
therefore, as if his ambitious projects as a conqueror were to find
their counterpart in his arrangements for recording their success, had
several authorized chroniclers, all men of consideration and learning.
But the shadow on the dial would not go back at the royal command. The
greatest monarch of his time could appoint chroniclers, but he could
not give them the spirit of an age that was past. The chronicles he
demanded at their hands were either never undertaken or never finished.
Antonio de Guevara, one of the persons to whom these duties were
assigned, seems to have been singularly conscientious in the devotion
of his time to them; for we are told, that, by his will, he ordered
the salary of one year, during which he had written nothing of his
task, to be returned to the Imperial treasury. This, however, did not
imply that he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[p. 554]</span>
successful chronicler.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885"
class="fnanchor">[885]</a> What he wrote was not thought worthy of
being published by his contemporaries, and would probably be judged
no more favorably by the present generation, unless it discovered
a greater regard for historical truth, and a better style, than
are found in his discussions on the life and character of the
Emperor Marcus Aurelius.<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886"
class="fnanchor">[886]</a></p>

<p>Florian de Ocampo, another of the more distinguished of the
chroniclers, showed a wide ambition in the plan he proposed to himself;
beginning his chronicles of Charles the Fifth as far back as the days
of Noah’s flood. As might have been foreseen, he lived only so long as
to finish a small fragment of his vast undertaking;—hardly a quarter
part of the first of its four grand divisions.<a id="FNanchor_887"
href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> But he went far enough
to show how completely the age for such writing was passed away.<a
id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> Not
that he failed in credulity; for of that he had more than enough. It
was not, however, the poetical credulity of his predecessors, trusting
to the old national traditions, but an easy faith, that believed in
the wearisome forgeries called the works of Berosus and Manetho,<a
id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>
which had been discredited from their first appearance half a century
before, and yet were now used by Ocampo as if they were the probable,
if not the sufficient, records of an uninterrupted succession of
Spanish kings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[p. 555]</span> from
Tubal, a grandson of Noah. Such a credulity has no charm about it. But
besides this, the work of Ocampo, in its very structure, is dry and
absurd; and, being written in a formal and heavy style, it is all but
impossible to read it. He died in 1555, the year the Emperor abdicated,
leaving us little occasion to regret that he had brought his annals of
Spain no lower down than the age of the Scipios.</p>

<p>Juan Ginez de Sepúlveda was also charged by the Emperor
fitly to record the events of his reign;<a id="FNanchor_890"
href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> and so
was Pero Mexia;<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891"
class="fnanchor">[891]</a> but the history of the former, which was
first published by the Academy in 1780, is in Latin, while that
of Mexia, written, apparently, after 1545, and coming down to the
coronation at Bologna, was never published at all.<a id="FNanchor_892"
href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> A larger history,
however, by the last author, consisting of the lives of all the Roman
emperors from Julius Cæsar to Maximilian of Austria, the predecessor
of Charles the Fifth, which was printed several times, and is spoken
of as an introduction to his Chronicle, shows, notwithstanding its
many imperfections of style, that his purpose was to write a true
and well-digested history, since he generally refers, under each
reign, to the authorities on which he relies.<a id="FNanchor_893"
href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[p. 556]</span>Such works
as these prove to us that we have reached the final limit of the
old chronicling style; and that we must now look for the appearance
of the different forms of regular historical composition in Spanish
literature. But before we approach them, we must pause a moment on a
few histories and accounts of the New World, which, during the reign
of Charles the Fifth, were of more importance than the imperfect
chronicles we have just noticed of the Spanish empire in Europe. For
as soon as the adventurers that followed Columbus were landed on the
western shores of the Atlantic, we begin to find narratives, more
or less ample, of their discoveries and settlements; some written
with spirit, and even in good taste; others quite unattractive in
their style; but nearly all interesting from their subject and their
materials, if from nothing else.</p>

<p>In the foreground of this picturesque group stands, as the most
brilliant of its figures, Fernando Cortés, called, by way of eminence,
<i>El Conquistador</i>, the Conqueror. He was born of noble parentage,
and carefully bred; and though his fiery spirit drove him from
Salamanca before his education could be completed, and brought him
to the New World, in 1504, when he was hardly nineteen years old,<a
id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
still the nurture of his youth, so much better than that of most
of the other American adventurers, is apparent in his voluminous
documents and letters, both published and unpublished. Of these,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[p. 557]</span> the most remarkable were,
no doubt, five long and detailed Reports to the Emperor on the affairs
of Mexico; the first of which, and probably the most curious, dated in
1519, seems to be lost, and the last, belonging, probably, to 1527,
exists only in manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895"
class="fnanchor">[895]</a> The four that remain are well written and
have a business-like air about them, as well as a clearness and good
taste which remind us sometimes, though rarely, of the “Relazioni” of
Machiavelli, and sometimes of Cæsar’s Commentaries. His letters, on
the other hand, are occasionally more ornamented. In an unpublished
one, written about 1533, and in which, when his fortunes were waning,
he sets forth his services and his wrongs, he pleases himself with
telling the Emperor that he “keeps two of his Majesty’s letters like
holy relics,” adding, that “the favors of his Majesty towards him
had been quite too ample for so small a vase”;—courtly and graceful
phrases, such as are not found in the documents of his later years,
when, disappointed and disgusted with affairs and with the court, he
retired to a morose solitude, where he died in 1554, little consoled by
his rank, his wealth, or his glory.</p>

<p>The marvellous achievements of Cortés in Mexico, however, were
more fully, if not more accurately, recorded by Francisco Lopez de
Gomara,—the oldest of the regular historians of the New World,<a
id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>—who
was born at Seville in 1510, and was, for some time, Professor of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[p. 558]</span> Rhetoric at Alcalá.
His early life, spent in the great mart of the American adventurers,
seems to have given him an interest in them and a knowledge of their
affairs which led him to write their history. The works he produced,
besides one or two of less consequence, were, first, his “History
of the Indies,” which, after the Spanish fashion, begins with the
creation of the world, and ends with the glories of Spain, though
it is chiefly devoted to Columbus and the discovery and conquest of
Peru; and, second, his “Chronicle of New Spain,” which is, in truth,
merely the History and Life of Cortés, and which, with this more
appropriate title, was reprinted by Bustamente, in Mexico, in 1826.<a
id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> As
the earliest records that were published concerning affairs which
already stirred the whole of Christendom, these works had, at once, a
great success, passing through two editions almost immediately, and
being soon translated into French and Italian.</p>

<p>But though Gomara’s style is easy and flowing, both in his mere
narration and in those parts of his works which so amply describe
the resources of the newly discovered countries, he did not succeed
in producing any thing of permanent authority. He was the secretary
of Cortés, and was misled by information received from him, and from
other persons, who were too much a part of the story they undertook
to relate to tell it fairly.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898"
class="fnanchor">[898]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[p.
559]</span> His mistakes, in consequence, are great and frequent,
and were exposed with much zeal by Bernal Diaz, an old soldier,
who, having already been twice to the New World, went with Cortés
to Mexico in 1519,<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899"
class="fnanchor">[899]</a> and fought there so often and so long,
that, many years afterwards, he declared he could sleep with comfort
only when his armour was on.<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900"
class="fnanchor">[900]</a> As soon as he read the accounts of
Gomara, he set himself sturdily at work to answer them, and in
1558 completed his task.<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901"
class="fnanchor">[901]</a> The book he thus produced is written with
much personal vanity, and runs, in a rude style, into wearisome
details; but it is full of the zealous and honest nationality of the
old chronicles, so that, while we are reading it, we seem to be carried
back into the preceding ages, and to be again in the midst of a sort of
fervor and faith which, in writers like Gomara and Cortés, we feel sure
we are fast leaving behind us.</p>

<p>Among the persons who early came to America, and have left important
records of their adventures and times, one of the most considerable
was Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo. He was born at Madrid, in 1478,<a
id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> and,
having been well educated at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella,
as one of the pages of Prince John, was sent out, in 1513, as a
supervisor of gold-smeltings, to San Domingo,<a id="FNanchor_903"
href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> where, except
occasional visits to Spain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[p.
560]</span> and to different Spanish possessions in America, he
lived nearly forty years, devoted to the affairs of the New World.
Oviedo seems, from his youth, to have had a passion for writing; and,
besides several less considerable works, among which were imperfect
chronicles of Ferdinand and Isabella and of Charles the Fifth, and a
life of Cardinal Ximenes,<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904"
class="fnanchor">[904]</a> he prepared two of no small value.</p>

<p>The most important of these two is “The Natural and General History
of the Indies,” filling fifty books, of which the first portions,
embracing twenty-one, were published in 1535, while the rest are still
found only in manuscript. As early as 1525, when he was at Toledo,
and offered Charles the Fifth a summary of the History of Hispaniola,
he speaks of his desire to have his larger work printed. But it
appears, from the beginning of the thirty-third book and the end of the
thirty-fourth, that he was still employed upon it in 1547 and 1548;
and it is not unlikely, from the words with which he concludes the
thirty-seventh, that he kept each of its larger divisions open, and
continued to make additions to them nearly to the time of his death.<a
id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[p. 561]</span>He tells us that
he had the Emperor’s authority to demand, from the different governors
of Spanish America, the documents he might need for his work;<a
id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>
and as his divisions of the subject are those which naturally arise
from its geography, he appears to have gone judiciously about his
task. But the materials he was to use were in too crude a state
to be easily manageable, and the whole subject was too wide and
various for his powers. He falls, therefore, into a loose, rambling
style, instead of aiming at philosophical condensation; and, far
from an abridgment, which his work ought to have been, he gives us
chronicling, documentary accounts of an immense extent of newly
discovered country, and of the extraordinary events that had been
passing there,—sometimes too short and slight to be interesting, and
sometimes too detailed for the reader’s patience. He was evidently a
learned man, and maintained a correspondence with Ramusio, the Italian
geographer, which could not fail to be useful to both parties.<a
id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>
And he was desirous to write in a good and eloquent style, in which
he sometimes succeeded. He has, therefore, on the whole, produced
a series of accounts of the natural condition, the aboriginal
inhabitants, and the political affairs of the wide-spread Spanish
possessions in America, as they stood in the middle of the sixteenth
century, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[p. 562]</span> is
of great value as a vast repository of facts, and not wholly without
merit as a composition.<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908"
class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p>The other considerable work of Oviedo, the fruit of his old age,
is devoted to fond recollections of his native country and of the
distinguished men he had known there. He calls it “Las Quinquagenas,”
and it consists of a series of dialogues, in which, with little method
or order, he gives gossiping accounts of the principal families that
figured in Spain during the times of Ferdinand and Isabella and
Charles the Fifth, mingled with anecdotes and recollections, such
as—not without a simple-hearted exhibition of his own vanity—the
memory of his long and busy life could furnish. It appears from<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[p. 563]</span> the Dialogue on Cardinal
Ximenes, and elsewhere, that he was employed on it as early as 1545;<a
id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>
but the year 1550 occurs yet more frequently among the dates of its
imaginary conversations,<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910"
class="fnanchor">[910]</a> and at the conclusion he very distinctly
declares that it was finished on the 23d of May, 1556, when he was
seventy-nine years old. He died in Valladolid, the next year.</p>

<p>But both during his life and after his death, Oviedo had a
formidable adversary, who, pursuing nearly the same course of inquiries
respecting the New World, came almost constantly to conclusions quite
opposite. This was no less a person than Bartolomé de las Casas, or
Casaus, the apostle and defender of the American Indians,—a man who
would have been remarkable in any age of the world, and who does not
seem yet to have gathered in the full harvest of his honors. He was
born in Seville, probably in 1474; and in 1502, having gone through
a course of studies at Salamanca, embarked for the Indies, where his
father, who had been there with Columbus nine years earlier, had
already accumulated a decent fortune.</p>

<p>The attention of the young man was early drawn to the condition
of the natives, from the circumstance, that one of them, given to
his father by Columbus, had been attached to his own person as a
slave, while he was still at the University; and he was not slow to
learn, on his arrival in Hispaniola, that their gentle natures and
slight frames had already been subjected, in the mines and in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[p. 564]</span> other forms of toil,
to a servitude so harsh, that the original inhabitants of the island
were beginning to waste away under the severity of their labors. From
this moment he devoted his life to their emancipation. In 1510 he
took holy orders, and continued as a priest, and for a short time as
Bishop of Chiapa, nearly forty years, to teach, strengthen, and console
the suffering flock committed to his charge. Six times, at least, he
crossed the Atlantic, in order to persuade the government of Charles
the Fifth to ameliorate their condition, and always with more or less
success. At last, but not until 1547, when he was above seventy years
old, he established himself at Valladolid, in Spain, where he passed
the remainder of his serene old age, giving it freely to the great
cause to which he had devoted the freshness of his youth. He died,
while on a visit of business, at Madrid, in 1566, at the advanced
age, as is commonly supposed, of ninety-two.<a id="FNanchor_911"
href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>Among the principal opponents of his benevolence were Sepúlveda,—one
of the leading men of letters and casuists of the time in Spain,—and
Oviedo, who, from his connection with the mines and his share in the
government of different parts of the newly discovered coun<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[p. 565]</span>tries, had an interest
directly opposite to the one Las Casas defended. These two persons,
with large means and a wide influence to sustain them, intrigued,
wrote, and toiled against him, in every way in their power. But his was
not a spirit to be daunted by opposition or deluded by sophistry and
intrigue; and when, in 1519, in a discussion with Sepúlveda concerning
the Indians, held in the presence of the young and proud Emperor
Charles the Fifth, Las Casas said, “It is quite certain, that, speaking
with all the respect and reverence due to so great a sovereign, I would
not, save in the way of duty and obedience as a subject, go from the
place where I now stand to the opposite corner of this room, to serve
your Majesty, unless I believed I should at the same time serve God,”<a
id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>—when
he said this, he uttered a sentiment that really governed his life and
constituted the basis of the great power he exercised. His works are
pervaded by it. The earliest of them, called “A very Short Account
of the Ruin of the Indies,” was written in 1542,<a id="FNanchor_913"
href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> and dedicated to the
prince, afterwards Philip the Second;—a tract in which, no doubt,
the sufferings and wrongs of the Indians are much overstated by the
indignant zeal of its author, but still one whose expositions are
founded in truth, and by their fervor awakened all Europe to a sense
of the injustice they set forth. Other short treatises followed,
written with similar spirit and power, especially those in reply
to Sepúlveda; but none was so often reprinted, either at home or
abroad, as the first,<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914"
class="fnanchor">[914]</a> and none ever produced<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_566">[p. 566]</span> so deep and solemn an effect on the
world. They were all collected and published in 1552; and, besides
being translated into other languages at the time, an edition in
Spanish, and a French version of the whole, with two more treatises
than were contained in the first collection, appeared at Paris in 1822,
prepared by Llorente.</p>

<p>The great work of Las Casas, however, still remains inedited,—a
General History of the Indies from 1492 to 1520, begun by him in 1527
and finished in 1561, but of which he ordered that no portion should
be published within forty years of his death. Like his other works, it
shows marks of haste and carelessness, and is written in a rambling
style; but its value, notwithstanding his too fervent zeal for the
Indians, is great. He had been personally acquainted with many of the
early discoverers and conquerors, and, at one time, possessed the
papers of Columbus, and a large mass of other important documents,
which are now lost. He says he had known Cortés “when he was so low
and humble, that he besought favor from the meanest servant of Diego
Velasquez”; and he knew him afterwards, he tells us, when, in his pride
of place at the court of the Emperor, he ventured to jest about the
pretty corsair’s part he had played in the affairs of Montezuma.<a
id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>
He knew, too, Gomara and Oviedo, and gives<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_567">[p. 567]</span> at large his reasons for differing
from them. In short, his book, divided into three parts, is a great
repository, to which Herrera, and through him all the historians of
the Indies since, have resorted for materials; and without which
the history of the earliest period of the Spanish settlements in
America cannot, even now, be properly written.<a id="FNanchor_916"
href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p>But it is not necessary to go farther into an examination of the old
accounts of the discovery and conquest of Spanish America, though there
are many more which, like those we have already considered, are partly
books of travel through countries full of wonders, partly chronicles
of adventures as strange as those of romance; frequently running into
idle and loose details, but as frequently fresh, picturesque, and manly
in their tone and coloring, and almost always curious from the facts
they record and the glimpses they give of manners and character. Among
those that might be added are the stories by Vaca of his shipwreck and
ten years’ captivity in Florida, from 1527 to 1537, and his subsequent
government for three years of the Rio de la Plata;<a id="FNanchor_917"
href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> the short account of
the conquest of Peru written by Francisco de Xerez,<a id="FNanchor_918"
href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> and the ampler one,
of the same wild achievements, which Augustin de Çarate began on
the spot, and was prevented by an officer of Gonzalo de Pizarro
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[p. 568]</span> finishing
till after his return home.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919"
class="fnanchor">[919]</a> But they may all be passed over, as of less
consequence than those we have noticed, which are quite sufficient
to give an idea, both of the nature of their class and the course it
followed,—a class much resembling the old chronicles, but yet one that
announces the approach of those more regular forms of history for which
it furnishes abundant materials.</p>

the northwestern part of Spain, and on which the civilization of the
country still rests: “Reserrés dans ce coin de terre, devenu pour eux
toute la patrie, Goths et Romains, vainqueurs et vaincus, étrangers
et indigènes, maîtres et esclaves, tous unis dans le même malheur,
oublièrent leurs vieilles haines, leur vieil éloignement, leurs

and following, as he always does, only Arabic authorities, Conde says,
“This fearful rout happened on Monday, the fifteenth day of the month
Safer, in the year 609 [A. D. 1212]; and with it fell the power of the
Moslems in Spain, for nothing turned out well with them after it.”
(Historia de la Dominacion de los Árabes en España, Madrid, 1820, 4to,
Tom. II. p. 425.) Gayangos, in his more learned and yet more entirely
Arabic “Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain,” (London, 1843, 4to, Vol. II.
p. 323,) gives a similar account. The purely Spanish historians, of
course, state the matter still more strongly;—Mariana, for instance,
looking upon the result of the battle as quite superhuman. Historia
General de España, 14a impresion, Madrid, 1780, fol., Lib. XI. c.
24.</p>

the old “Crónica General de España,” (Zamora, 1541, fol., f. 275,) “was
the war of the Moors very grievous; so that the kings, and counts, and
nobles, and all the knights that took pride in arms, stabled their
horses in the rooms where they slept with their wives; to the end that,
when they heard the war-cry, they might find their horses and arms at
hand, and mount instantly at its summons.” “A hard and rude training,”
says Martinez de la Rosa, in his graceful romance of “Isabel de Solís,”
recollecting, I suspect, this very passage,—“a hard and rude training,
the prelude to so many glories and to the conquest of the world, when
our forefathers, weighed down with harness, and their swords always in
hand, slept at ease no single night for eight centuries.” Doña Isabel

<p id="Footnote_7"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_7">[7]</a></span> The date of the only early manuscript
of the Poem of the Cid is in these words: “Per Abbat le escribio en el
mes de Mayo, en Era de Mill è CC..XLV años.” There is a blank made by
an erasure between the second C and the X, which has given rise to the
question, whether this erasure was made by the copyist because he had
accidentally put in a letter too much, or whether it is a subsequent
erasure that ought to be filled,—and, if filled, whether with the
conjunction <i>è</i> or with another C; in short, the question is, whether
this manuscript should be dated in 1245 or in 1345. (Sanchez, Poesías
Anteriores, Madrid, 1779, 8vo, Tom. I. p. 221.) This year, 1245,
<i>of the Spanish era</i>, according to which the calculation of time is
commonly kept in the elder Spanish records, corresponds to our A. D.
1207;—a difference of 38 years, the reason for which may be found in a
note to Southey’s “Chronicle of the Cid,” (London, 1808, 4to, p. 385,)
without seeking it in more learned sources.</p>

<p class="ti1">The date of <i>the poem itself</i>, however, is a very
different question from the date of <i>this particular manuscript</i> of
it; for the <i>Per Abbat</i> referred to is merely the copyist, whether his
name was Peter Abbat or Peter the Abbot, (Risco, Castilla, etc., p.
68.) This question—the one, I mean, of the age of <i>the poem itself</i>—can
be settled only from internal evidence of style and language. Two
passages, vv. 3014 and 3735, have, indeed, been alleged (Risco, p. 69,
Southey’s Chronicle, p. 282, note) to prove its date historically; but,
after all, they only show that it was written subsequently to A. D.
1135. (V. A. Huber, Geschichte des Cid, Bremen, 1829, 12mo, p. xxix.)
The point is one difficult to settle; and none can be consulted about
it but natives or <i>experts</i>. Of these, Sanchez places it at about 1150,
or half a century after the death of the Cid, (Poesías Anteriores,
Tom. I. p. 223,) and Capmany (Eloquencia Española, Madrid, 1786, 8vo,
Tom. I. p. 1) follows him. Marina, whose opinion is of great weight,
(Memorias de la Academia de Historia, Tom. IV. 1805, Ensayo, p. 34,)
places it thirty or forty years before Berceo, who wrote 1220-1240.
The editors of the Spanish translation of Bouterwek, (Madrid, 1829,
8vo, Tom. I. p. 112,) who give a fac-simile of the manuscript, agree
with Sanchez, and so does Huber (Gesch. des Cid, Vorwort, p. xxvii.).
To these opinions may be added that of Ferdinand Wolf, of Vienna,
(Jahrbücher der Literatur, Wien, 1831, Band LVI. p. 251,) who, like
Huber, is one of the acutest scholars alive in whatever touches Spanish
and Mediæval literature, and who places it about 1140-1160. Many other
opinions might be cited, for the subject has been much discussed; but
the judgments of the learned men already given, formed at different
times in the course of half a century from the period of the first
publication of the poem, and concurring so nearly, leave no reasonable
doubt that it was composed as early as the year 1200.</p>

<p class="ti1">Mr. Southey’s name, introduced by me in this note, is
one that must always be mentioned with peculiar respect by scholars
interested in Spanish literature. From the circumstance, that his
uncle, the Rev. Herbert Hill, a scholar, and a careful and industrious
one, was connected with the English Factory at Lisbon, Mr. Southey
visited Spain and Portugal in 1795-6, when he was about twenty-two
years old, and, on his return home, published his Travels, in 1797;—a
pleasant book, written in the clear, idiomatic, picturesque English
that always distinguishes his style, and containing a considerable
number of translations from the Spanish and the Portuguese, made with
freedom and spirit rather than with great exactness. From this time he
never lost sight of Spain and Portugal, or of Spanish and Portuguese
literature; as is shown, not only by several of his larger original
works, but by his translations, and by his articles in the London
Quarterly Review on Lope de Vega and Camoens; especially by one in the
second volume of that journal, which was translated into Portuguese,
with notes, by Müller, Secretary of the Academy of Sciences at Lisbon,
and so made into an excellent compact manual for Portuguese literary
history.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_8"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_8">[8]</a></span> The Arabic accounts represent the Cid
as having died of grief, at the defeat of the Christians near Valencia,
which fell again into the hands of the Moslem in 1100. (Gayangos,
Mohammedan Dynasties, Vol. II. Appendix, p. xliii.) It is necessary to
read some one of the many Lives of the Cid in order to understand the
Poema del Cid, and much else of Spanish literature; I will therefore
notice four or five of the more suitable and important. 1. The oldest
is the Latin “Historia Didaci Campidocti,” written before 1238, and
published as an Appendix in Risco. 2. The next is the cumbrous and
credulous one by Father Risco, 1792. 3. Then we have a curious one
by John von Müller, the historian of Switzerland, 1805, prefixed to
his friend Herder’s Ballads of the Cid. 4. The classical Life by
Manuel Josef Quintana, in the first volume of his “Vidas de Españoles
Célebres” (Madrid, 1807, 12mo). 5. That of Huber, 1829; acute and safe.
The best of all, however, is the old Spanish “Chronicle of the Cid,”
or Southey’s Chronicle, 1808;—the best, I mean, for those who read in
order to enjoy what may be called the literature of the Cid;—to which
may be added a pleasant little volume by George Dennis, entitled “The
Cid, a Short Chronicle founded on the Early Poetry of Spain,” London,
1845, 12mo.</p>

Moorish accounts of the Cid with the Christian. In the work of Conde on
the Arabs of Spain, which is little more than a translation from Arabic
chronicles, the Cid appears first, I think, in the year 1087, when he
is called “the Cambitur [Campeador] who <i>infested</i> the frontiers of
Valencia.” (Tom. II. p. 155.) When he had taken Valencia, in 1094, we
are told, “Then the Cambitur—<i>may he be accursed of Allah!</i>—entered in
with all his people and allies.” (Tom. II. p. 183.) In other places he
is called “Roderic the Cambitur,”—“Roderic, Chief of the Christians,
known as the Cambitur,”—and “the Accursed”;—all proving how thoroughly
he was hated and feared by his enemies. He is nowhere, I think, called
Cid or Seid by Arab writers; and the reason why he appears in Conde’s
work so little is, probably, that the manuscripts used by that writer
relate chiefly to the history of events in Andalusia and Granada, where
the Cid did not figure at all. The tone in Gayangos’s more learned and
accurate work on the Mohammedan Dynasties is the same. When the Cid
dies, the Arab chronicler (Vol. II. App., p. xliii.) adds, “May God not
show him mercy!”</p>

Müller and of Southey, the latter of whom says, in the Preface to
his Chronicle, (p. xi.,) “The poem is to be considered as metrical
history, not as metrical romance.” But Huber, in the excellent Vorwort
to his Geschichte, (p. xxvi.,) shows this to be a mistake; and in the
introduction to his edition of the Chronicle, (Marburg, 1844, 8vo, p.
xlii.,) shows further, that the poem was certainly not taken from the
old Latin Life, which is the proper foundation for what is historical
in our account of the Cid.</p>

<p id="Footnote_14"><span class="label"><a

the history of the Cid, and decides nothing (Historia, Lib. X. c.
4);—Sandoval controverts much, and entirely denies the story of the
Counts of Carrion (Reyes de Castilla, Pamplona, 1615, fol., f. 54);—and
Ferreras (Synopsis Histórica, Madrid, 1775, 4to, Tom. V. pp. 196-198)
endeavours to settle what is true and what is fabulous, and agrees
with Sandoval about the marriage of the daughters of the Cid with the
Counts. Southey (Chronicle, pp. 310-312) argues both sides, and shows
his desire to believe the story, but does not absolutely succeed in
doing so.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_15"><span class="label"><a

by Sanchez, in the first volume of his valuable “Poesías Castellanas
Anteriores al Siglo XV.” (Madrid, 1779-90, 4 tom., 8vo; reprinted by
Ochoa, Paris, 1842, 8vo.) It contains three thousand seven hundred
and forty-four lines, and, if the deficiencies in the manuscript were
supplied, Sanchez thinks the whole would come up to about four thousand
lines. But he saw a copy made in 1596, which, though not entirely
faithful, showed that the older manuscript had the same deficiencies
then that it has now. Of course, there is little chance that they will
ever be supplied.</p>

<p id="Footnote_16"><span class="label"><a

lines on the famine in Valencia during its Siege by the Cid:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Mal se aquexan los de Valencia · que non sabent ques’ far;</p>
<p class="i0">De ninguna part que sea · no les viene pan;</p>
<p class="i0">Nin da consejo padre à fijo, · nin fijo à padre:</p>
<p class="i0">Nin amigo à amigo nos · pueden consolar.</p>
<p class="i0">Mala cuenta es, Señores, · aver mengua de pan,</p>
<p class="i0">Fijos e mugieres verlo · morir de fambre.</p>
<p class="dr">vv. 1183-1188.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Valencian men doubt what to do, · and bitterly complain,</p>
<p class="i0">That, wheresoe’er they look for bread, · they look for it in vain.</p>
<p class="i0">No father help can give his child, · no son can help his sire,</p>
<p class="i0">Nor friend to friend assistance lend, · or cheerfulness inspire.</p>
<p class="i0">A grievous story, Sirs, it is, · when fails the needed bread,</p>
<p class="i0">And women fair and children young · in hunger join the dead.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the use of <i>Señores</i>, “Sirs,” in this passage, as well as
from other lines, like v. 734 and v. 2291, I have thought the poem
was either originally addressed to some particular persons, or was
intended—which is most in accordance with the spirit of the age—to be
recited publicly.</p>

<p class="ti1">Some of the irregularities of the versification may be
owing to the copyist, as we have but one manuscript to depend upon; but
they are too grave and too abundant to be charged, on the whole, to any

translations were made by Mr. J. Hookham Frere, one of the most
accomplished scholars England has produced, and one whom Sir James
Mackintosh has pronounced to be the first of English translators. He
was, for some years, British Minister in Spain, and, by a conjectural
emendation which he made of a line in <i>this very poem</i>, known only to
himself and the Marquis de la Romana, was able to accredit a secret
agent to the latter in 1808, when he was commanding a body of Spanish
troops in the French service on the soil of Denmark;—a circumstance
that led to one of the most important movements in the war against
Bonaparte. (Southey’s History of the Peninsular War, London, 1823, 4to,
Tom. I. p. 657.) The admirable translations of Mr. Frere from the Poem
of the Cid, are to be found in the Appendix to Southey’s Chronicle of
the Cid; itself an entertaining book, made out of free versions and
compositions from the Spanish Poem of the Cid, the old ballads, the
prose Chronicle of the Cid, and the General Chronicle of Spain. Mr. Wm.
Godwin, in a somewhat singular “Letter of Advice to a Young American on
a Course of Studies,” (London, 1818, 8vo,) commends it justly as one of
the books best calculated to give an idea of the age of chivalry.</p>

<p class="ti1">It is proper I should add here, that, except in this
case of the Poem of the Cid, where I am indebted to Mr. Frere for the
passages in the text, and in the case of the Coplas of Manrique, (Chap.
21 of this Period,) where I am indebted to the beautiful version of Mr.
Longfellow, the translations in these volumes are made by myself.</p>

less distinctly marked, have led Tapia (Historia de la Civilización de
España, Madrid, 1840, 12mo, Tom. I. p. 268) to think, that the whole
poem is but a congeries of ballads, as the Iliad has sometimes been
thought to be, and, as there is little doubt, the Nibelungenlied really
is. But such breaks occur so frequently in different parts of it, and
seem so generally to be made for other reasons, that this conjecture is
not probable. (Huber, Chrónica del Cid, p. xl.) Besides, the whole poem
more resembles the Chansons de Geste of old French poetry, and is more
artificial in its structure, than the nature of the ballad permits.</p>

<p class="ti1">A parallel passage from Chaucer’s “Knight’s Tale”—the

<p class="ti1">And so on twenty lines farther, both in the English
and the Spanish. But it should be borne in mind, when comparing them,
that the Poem of the Cid was written two centuries earlier than the
“Canterbury Tales” were.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_23"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_23">[23]</a></span> The change of opinion in relation
to the Poema del Cid, and the different estimates of its value, are
remarkable circumstances in its history. Bouterwek speaks of it very
slightingly,—probably from following Sarmiento, who had not read
it,—and the Spanish translators of Bouterwek almost agree with him.
F. v. Schlegel, however, Sismondi, Huber, Wolf, and nearly or quite
all who have spoken of it of late, express a strong admiration of its
merits. There is, I think, truth in the remark of Southey (Quarterly
Review, 1814, Vol. XII. p. 64): “The Spaniards have not yet discovered
the high value of their metrical history of the Cid, as a poem; they
will never produce any thing great in the higher branches of art, till
they have cast off the false taste which prevents them from perceiving
it.”</p>

<p class="ti1">Of all poems belonging to the early ages of any modern
nation, the one that can best be compared with the Poem of the Cid
is the Nibelungenlied, which, according to the most judicious among
the German critics, dates, in its present form at least, about half
a century after the time assigned to the Poem of the Cid. A parallel
might easily be run between them, that would be curious.</p>

<p class="ti1 mt2">In the Jahrbücher der Literatur, Wien, 1846, Band
CXVI., M. Francisque Michel, the scholar to whom the literature of the
Middle Ages owes so much, published, for the first time, what remains
of an old poetical Spanish chronicle,—“Chrónica Rimada de las Cosas de
España,”—on the history of Spain from the death of Pelayo to Ferdinand
the Great;—the same poem that is noticed in Ochoa, “Catálogo de
Manuscritos,” (Paris, 1844, 4to, pp. 106-110,) and in Huber’s edition
of the Chronicle of the Cid, Preface, App. E.</p>

<p class="ti1">It is a curious, though not important, contribution
to our resources in early Spanish literature, and one that
immediately reminds us of the old Poem of the Cid. It begins with
a prose introduction on the state of affairs down to the time of
Fernan Gonzalez, compressed into a single page, and then goes on
through eleven hundred and twenty-six lines of verse, when it breaks
off abruptly in the middle of a line, as if the copyist had been
interrupted, but with no sign that the work was drawing to an end.
Nearly the whole of it is taken up with the history of the Cid, his
family and his adventures, which are sometimes different from those in
the old ballads and chronicles. Thus, Ximena is represented as having
three brothers, who are taken prisoners by the Moors and released by
the Cid; and the Cid is made to marry Ximena, by the royal command,
against his own will; after which he goes to Paris, in the days of
the Twelve Peers, and performs feats like those in the romances of
chivalry. This, of course, is all new. But the old stories are altered
and amplified, like those of the Cid’s charity to the leper, which is
given with a more picturesque air, and of Ximena and the king, and
of the Cid and his father, which are partly thrown into dialogue,
not without dramatic effect. The whole is a free version of the old
traditions of the country, apparently made in the fifteenth century,
after the fictions of chivalry began to be known, and with the
intention of giving the Cid rank among their heroes.</p>

<p class="ti1">The measure is that of the long verses used in the older
Spanish poetry, with a cæsural pause near the middle of each, and the
termination of the lines is in the <i>asonante</i> a-o.<a id="FNanchor_23_1"
href="#Footnote_23_1" class="fnanchor">[*]</a> But in all this there
is great irregularity;—many of the verses running out to twenty or
more syllables, and several passages failing to observe the proper
<i>asonante</i>. Every thing indicates that the old ballads were familiar to
the author, and from one passage I infer that he knew the old poem of
the Cid:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Veredes lidiar a porfia · e tan firme se dar,</p>
<p class="i0">Atantos pendones obrados · alçar e abaxar,</p>
<p class="i0">Atantas lanças quebradas · por el primor quebrar,</p>
<p class="i0">Atantos cavallos caer · e non se levantar,</p>
<p class="i0">Atanto cavallo sin dueño · por el campo andar.</p>
<p class="dr">vv. 895-899.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti1">The preceding lines seem imitated from the Cid’s fight
before Alcocer, in such a way as to leave no doubt that its author had
seen the old poem:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Veriedes tantas lanzas · premer è alzar;</p>
<p class="i0">Tanta adarga à · foradar è pasar;</p>
<p class="i0">Tanta loriga falsa · desmanchar;</p>
<p class="i0">Tantos pendones blancos · salir bermeios en sangre;</p>
<p class="i0">Tantos buenos cavallos · sin sos duenos andar.</p>
<p class="dr">vv. 734-738.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_24"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_24">[24]</a></span> The only knowledge of the
manuscript containing these three poems was long derived from a few
extracts in the “Biblioteca Española” of Rodriguez de Castro;—an
important work, whose author was born in Galicia, in 1739, and died at
Madrid, in 1799. The first volume, printed in 1781, in folio, under
the patronage of the Count Florida Blanca, consists of a chronological
account of the Rabbinical writers who appeared in Spain from the
earliest times to his own, whether they wrote in Hebrew, Spanish, or
any other language. The second, printed in 1786, consists of a similar
account of the Spanish writers, heathen and Christian, who wrote either
in Latin or in Spanish down to the end of the thirteenth century, and
whose number he makes about two hundred. Both volumes are somewhat
inartifically compiled, and the literary opinions they express are of
small value; but their materials, largely derived from manuscripts, are
curious, and frequently such as can be found in print nowhere else.</p>

<p class="ti1">In this work, (Madrid, 1786, fol., Vol. II. pp. 504,
505,) and for a long time, as I have said, there alone, were found
notices of these poems; but all of them were printed at the end of the
Paris edition of Sanchez’s “Coleccion de Poesías Anteriores al Siglo
XV.,” from a copy of the original manuscript in the Escurial, marked
there III. K. 4to. Judging by the specimens given in De Castro, the
spelling of the manuscript has not been carefully followed in the copy
used for the Paris edition.</p>

of Tyre, as it is commonly called, and as we have its incidents in
this long poem, is the 153d tale of the “Gesta Romanorum” (s. l.,
1488, fol.). It is, however, much older than that collection. (Douce,
Illustrations of Shakspeare, London, 1807, 8vo, Vol. II. p. 135; and
Swan’s translation of the Gesta, London, 1824, 12mo, Vol. II. pp.
164-495.) Two words in the original Spanish of the passage translated
in the text should be explained. The author says,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">Estudiar querria</p>
<p class="i0">Componer un <i>romance</i> de nueva <i>maestría</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Romance</i> here evidently means <i>story</i>, and this is the earliest
use of the word in this sense that I know of. <i>Maestría</i>, like our old
English <i>Maisterie</i>, means <i>art</i> or <i>skill</i>, as in Chaucer, being the
word afterwards corrupted into <i>Mystery</i>.</p>

great repute in Spain and Portugal, and had her adventures written by
Pedro de Ribadeneyra in 1609, and Diogo Vas Carrillo in 1673; they were
also fully given in the “Flos Sanctorum” of the former, and, in a more
attractive form, by Bartolomé Cayrasco de Figueroa, at the end of his
“Templo Militante,” (Valladolid, 1602, 12mo,) where they fill about 130
flowing octave stanzas, and by Montalvan, in the drama of “La Gitana de
Menfis.” She has, too, a church dedicated to her at Rome on the bank
of the Tiber, made out of the graceful ruins of the temple of Fortuna
Virilis. But her coarse history has often been rejected as apocryphal,
or at least as unfit to be repeated. Bayle, Dictionaire Historique et

as it would seem, from bad copies. At least, they contain many more
inaccuracies of spelling, versification, and style than the first, and
appear to be of a later age; for I do not think the French Fabliaux,
which they imitate, were known in Spain till after the period commonly
assigned to the Apollonius.</p>

<p class="ti1">There was, no doubt, difficulty in such a protracted
system of rhyme, but not much; and when rhyme first appeared in the
modern languages, an excess of it was the natural consequence of its
novelty. In large portions of the Provençal poetry, its abundance
is quite ridiculous; as in the “Croisade contre les Hérétiques
Albigeois,”—a remarkable poem, dating from 1210, excellently edited
by M. C. Fauriel, (Paris, 1837, 4to,)—in which stanzas occur where
the same rhyme is repeated above a hundred times. When and where this
quaternion rhyme, as it is used by Berceo, was first introduced, cannot
be determined; but it seems to have been very early employed in poems
that were to be publicly recited. (F. Wolf, Ueber die Lais, Wien. 1841,
8vo, p. 257.) The oldest example I know of it, in a modern dialect,
dates from about 1100, and is found in the curious MS. of Poetry of
the Waldenses (F. Diez, Troubadours, Zwickau, 1826, 8vo, p. 230) used
by Raynouard;—the instance to which I refer being “Lo novel Confort,”
(Poésies des Troubadours, Paris, 1817, 8vo, Tom. II. p. 111,) which
begins,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Aquest novel confort de vertuos lavor</p>
<p class="i0">Mando, vos scrivent en carita et en amor:</p>
<p class="i0">Prego vos carament per l’amor del segnor,</p>
<p class="i0">Abandona lo segle, serve a Dio cum temor.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In Spain, whither it no doubt came from Provence, its history is
simply,—that it occurs in the poem of Apollonius; that it gets its
first known date in Berceo about 1230; and that it continued in use
till the end of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class="ti1">The thirteen thousand verses of Berceo’s poetry,
including even the Hymns, are, with the exception of about twenty
lines of the “Duelo de la Vírgen,” in this measure. These twenty lines
constitute a song of the Jews who watched the sepulchre after the
crucifixion, and, like the parts of the demons in the old Mysteries,
are intended to be droll, but are, in fact, as Berceo himself says of
them, more truly than perhaps he was aware, “not worth three figs.”
They are, however, of some consequence, as perhaps the earliest
specimen of Spanish lyrical poetry that has come down to us with a
date. They begin thus:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Velat, aliama de los Judios,</p>
<p class="i2">Eya velar!</p>
<p class="i0">Que no vos furten el fijo de Dios,</p>
<p class="i2">Eya velar!</p>
<p class="i0">Car furtarvoslo querran,</p>
<p class="i2">Eya velar!</p>
<p class="i0">Andre è Piedro et Johan,</p>
<p class="i2">Eya velar!</p>
<p class="dr">Duelo, 178-9.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Watch, congregation of the Jew,</p>
<p class="i2">Up and watch!</p>
<p class="i0">Lest they should steal God’s son from you,</p>
<p class="i2">Up and watch!</p>
<p class="i0">For they will seek to steal the son,</p>
<p class="i2">Up and watch!</p>
<p class="i0">His followers, Andrew, and Peter, and John,</p>
<p class="i2">Up and watch!</p>

<p>Sanchez considers it a <i>Villancico</i>, to be sung like a litany (Tom.
IV. p. ix.); and Martinez de la Rosa treats it much in the same way.
Obras, Paris, 1827, 12mo, Tom. I. p. 161.</p>

<p class="ti1">In general, the versification of Berceo is
regular,—sometimes it is harmonious; and though he now and then
indulges himself in imperfect rhymes, that may be the beginning of
the national <i>asonantes</i> (Sanchez, Tom. II. p. xv.) still the license
he takes is much less than might be anticipated. Indeed, Sanchez
represents the harmony and finish of his versification as quite
surprising, and uses stronger language in relation to it than seems
justifiable, considering some of the facts he admits. Tom. II. p.
xi.</p>

<p class="ti1 mt1">This has, no doubt, a very Provençal air; but others
of the Cántigas have still more of it. The Provençal poets, in fact,
as we shall see more fully hereafter, fled in considerable numbers
into Spain at the period of their persecution at home; and that
period corresponds to the reigns of Alfonso and his father. In this
way a strong tinge of the Provençal character came into the poetry
of Castile, and remained there a long time. The proofs of this early
intercourse with Provençal poets are abundant. Aiméric de Bellinoi was
at the court of Alfonso IX., who died in 1214, (Histoire Littéraire de
la France, par des Membres de l’Institut, Paris, 4to, Tom. XIX. 1838,
p. 507,) and was afterwards at the court of Alfonso X. (Ibid., p. 511.)
So were Montagnagout, and Folquet de Lunel, both of whom wrote poems
on the election of Alfonso X. to the throne of Germany. (Ibid., Tom.
XIX. p. 491, and Tom. XX. p. 557; with Raynouard, Troubadours, Tom. IV.
p. 239.) Raimond de Tours and Nat de Mons addressed verses to Alfonso
X. (Ibid., Tom. XIX. pp. 555, 577.) Bertrand Carbonel dedicated his
works to him; and Giraud Riquier, sometimes called the last of the
Troubadours, wrote an elegy on his death, already referred to. (Ibid.,
Tom. XX. pp. 559, 578, 584.) Others might be cited, but these are
enough.</p>

(Poesías Anteriores, Tom. I. pp. 148-170,) where it may still be best
consulted. The copy he used had belonged to the Marquis of Villena,
who was suspected of the black art, and whose books were burnt on
that account after his death, temp. John II. A specimen of the cipher
is given in Cortinas’s translation of Bouterwek (Tom. I. p. 129). In
reading this poem, it should be borne in mind that Alfonso believed in
astrological predictions, and protected astrology by his laws. (Partida
VII. Tít. xxiii. Ley 1.) Moratin the younger (Obras, Madrid, 1830, 8vo,
Tom. I. Parte I. p. 61) thinks that both the Querellas and the Tesoro
were the work of the Marquis of Villena; relying, first, on the fact
that the only manuscript of the latter known to exist once belonged to
the Marquis; and, secondly, on the obvious difference in language and
style between both and the rest of the king’s known works,—a difference
which certainly may well excite suspicion, but does not much encourage
the particular conjecture of Moratin as to the Marquis of Villena.</p>

additions are made to it is apparent from Lib. III. c. 170, where is an
account of the overthrow of the order of the Templars, which is there
said to have happened in the year of the Spanish era 1412; and that it
is a translation, so far as it follows William of Tyre, from an old
French version of the thirteenth century, I state on the authority of a
manuscript of Sarmiento. The Conquista begins thus:—</p>

<p class="ti1">“Capitulo Primero. Como Mahoma predico en Aravia: y gano
toda la tierra de Oriente.</p>

<p class="ti1">“En aql. tiēpo q̄ eraclius emperador en Roma q̄ fue buē
Xpiano, et mātuvo gran tiēpo el imperio en justicia y en paz, levantose
Mahoma en tierra de Aravia y mostro a las gētes necias sciēcia nueva,
y fizo les creer q̄ era profeta y mensagero de dios, y que le avia
embiado al mundo por saluar los hombres qēle creyessen,” etc.</p>

<p class="ti1">The story of the Knight of the Swan, full of
enchantments, duels, and much of what marks the books of chivalry,
begins abruptly at Lib. 1. cap. 47, fol. xvii., with these words: “And
now the history leaves off speaking for a time of all these things,
in order to relate what concerns the Knight of the Swan,” etc.; and
it ends with Cap. 185, f. lxxx., the next chapter opening thus: “Now
this history leaves off speaking of this, and turns to relate how three
knights went to Jerusalem,” etc. This story of the Knight of the Swan,
which fills 63 leaves, or about a quarter part of the whole work,
appeared originally in Normandy or Belgium, begun by Jehan Renault and
finished by Gandor or Graindor of Douay, in 30,000 verses, about the
year 1300. (De la Rue, Essai sur les Bardes, etc., Caen, 1834, 8vo,
Tom. III. p. 213. Warton’s English Poetry, London, 1824, 8vo, Vol. II.
p. 149. Collection of Prose Romances, by Thoms, London, 1838, 12mo,
Vol. III., Preface.) It was, I suppose, inserted in the Ultramar, when
the Ultramar was prepared for publication, because it was supposed to
illustrate and dignify the history of Godfrey of Bouillon, its hero;
but this is not the only part of the work made up later than its date.
The last chapter, for instance, giving an account of the death of
Conradin of the Hohenstauffen, and the assassination in the church of
Viterbo, at the moment of the elevation of the host, of Henry, the
grandson of Henry III. of England, by Guy of Monfort,—both noticed by
Dante,—has nothing to do with the main work, and seems taken from some
later chronicle.</p>

<p id="Footnote_62"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_62">[62]</a></span> There is a curious collection of
documents, published by royal authority, (Madrid, 1829-33, 6 tom.
8vo,) called “Coleccion de Cédulas, Cartas, Patentes,” etc., relating
to Biscay and the Northern provinces, where the Castilian first
appeared. They contain nothing in that language so old as the letter
of confirmation to the Fueros of Avilés by Alfonso the Seventh already
noted; but they contain materials of some value for tracing the decay
of the Latin, by documents dated from the year 804 downwards. (Tom. VI.
p. 1.) There is, however, a difficulty relating both to the documents
in Latin and to those in the early modern dialect; e. g. in relation to
the one in Tom. V. p. 120, dated 1197. It is, that we are not certain
that we possess them in precisely their <i>original</i> form and integrity.
Indeed, in not a few instances we are sure of the opposite. For these
Fueros, Privilegios, or whatever they are called, being but arbitrary
grants of an absolute monarch, the persons to whom they were made were
careful to procure confirmations of them from succeeding sovereigns,
as often as they could; and when these confirmations were made, the
original document, if in Latin, was sometimes translated, as was that
of Peter the Cruel, given by Marina (Teoría de las Cortes, Madrid,
1813, 4to, Tom. III. p. 11); or, if in the modern dialect, it was
sometimes copied and accommodated to the changed language and spelling
of the age. Such confirmations were in some cases numerous, as in the
grant first cited, which was confirmed thirteen times between 1231
and 1621. Now it does not appear from the published documents in this
Coleccion what is, in each instance, the true date of the particular
version used. The Avilés document, however, is not liable to this
objection. It is extant on the original parchment, upon which the
confirmation was made in 1155, with the original signatures of the
persons who made it, as testified by the most competent witnesses. See
<i>post</i>, Vol. III., Appendix (A), near the end.</p>

which signifies the same as Forum Judicum, and is perhaps a corruption
of it. (Covarrubias, Tesoro, Madrid, 1674, fol., <i>ad verb.</i>) The first

the most curious passage in the Fuero Juzgo is the law (Lib. XII. Tít.
iii. Ley 15) containing the tremendous oath of abjuration prescribed
to those Jews who were about to enter the Christian Church. But I
prefer to give as a specimen of its language one of a more liberal
spirit, viz., the eighth Law of the Primero Titolo, or Introduction,
“concerning those who may become kings,” which in the Latin original
dates from A. D. 643: “Quando el rey morre, nengun non deve tomar el
regno, nen facerse rey, nen ningun religioso, nen otro omne, nen servo,
nen otro omne estrano, se non omne de linage de los godos, et fillo
dalgo, et noble et digno de costumpnes, et con el otorgamiento de los
obispos, et de los godos mayores, et de todo el poblo. Asi que mientre
que fórmos todos de un corazon, et de una veluntat, et de una fé, que
sea entre nos paz et justicia enno regno, et que podamos ganar la
companna de los angeles en el otro sieglo; et aquel que quebrantar esta

Aristóteles á Alexandro que él puñase de haber en si franqueza, ca por

que franqueza es dar al que lo ha menester et al que lo meresce, segunt
el poder del dador, dando de lo suyo et non tomando de lo ageno para
darlo á otro, ca el que da mas de lo que puede non es franco, mas

des faits d’Alexandre.” There is an account of a French poem on this
subject, in the “Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque

frequently made in ancient times over favorite birds (Barante, Ducs de
Bourgogne, ad an. 1454, Paris, 1837, 8vo, Tom. VII. pp. 159-164); and

2. Book of Hunting; 3. Book of Poetry; and 4. Book of Counsels to his

2. Libro del Caballero; 3. Libro del Escudero; 4. Libro del Infante;
5. Libro de Caballeros; 6. Libro de los Engaños; and 7. Libro de los
Exemplos. The manuscript gives, besides the four that are clearly
in common, the following:—1. Letter to his brother, containing an
account of the family arms, etc.; 2. Book of Conditions, or Libro de
los Estados, which may be Argote de Molina’s Libro de los Sabios; 3.
Libro del Caballero y del Escudero, of which Argote de Molina seems to
make two separate works; 4. Libro de la Caballería, probably Argote de
Molina’s Libro de Caballeros; 5. La Cumplida; 6. Libro de los Engeños,
a treatise on Military Engines, misspelt by Argote de Molina, Engaños,
so as to make it a treatise on <i>Frauds</i>; and 7. Reglas como se deve

it says there were twelve works, gives the titles of only eleven, and
omits the Conde Lucanor, which is the Libro de los Exemplos of Argote’s

Alfonso XI., as, for instance, those in the Cancionero of Antwerp
(1573, 8vo, ff. 175, 207, 227, 267). But they are not his. Their
language and thoughts are quite too modern. Probably they are the work
of Don John Manuel who was Camareiro Mòr of King Emanuel of Portugal,
(† 1524,) and whose poems, both in Portuguese and in Spanish, figure
largely in the Cancioneiro Gerale of Garcia Rresende, (Lisboa, 1516,
fol.,) where they are found at ff. 48-57, 148, 169, 212, 230, and I
believe in some other places. He is the author of the Spanish “Coplas
sobre los Siete Pecados Mortales,” dedicated to John II. of Portugal,
(† 1495,) which are in Bohl de Faber’s “Floresta,” (Hamburgo, 1821-25,
8vo, Tom. I. pp. 10-15,) taken from Rresende, f. 55, in one of the
three copies of whose Cancioneiro then existing (that at the Convent
of the Necessidades in Lisbon) I read them many years ago. Rresende’s
Cancioneiro is now no longer so rare, being in course of publication
by the Stuttgard Verein. The Portuguese Don John Manuel was a person
of much consideration in his time; and in 1497 concluded a treaty for
the marriage of King Emanuel of Portugal with Isabella, daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. (Barbosa, Biblioteca Lusitana, Lisboa,
1747, fol., Tom. II. p. 688.) But he appears very little to his honor
in Lope de Vega’s play entitled “El Príncipe Perfeto,” under the name
of Don Juan de Sosa. Comedias, Tom. XI., Barcelona, 1618, 4to, p.
121.</p>

<p id="Footnote_104"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_104">[104]</a></span> A similar story is told of Dante,
who was a contemporary of Don John Manuel, by Sachetti, who lived about
a century after both of them. It is in his Novella 114, (Milano, 1815,
18mo, Tom. II. p. 154,) where, after giving an account of an important
affair, about which Dante was desired to solicit one of the city
officers, the story goes on thus:—</p>

<p class="ti1">“When Dante had dined, he left his house to go about
that business, and, passing through the Porta San Piero, heard a
blacksmith singing as he beat the iron on his anvil. What he sang was
from Dante, and he did it as if it were a ballad, (<i>un cantare</i>,)
jumbling the verses together, and mangling and altering them in a
way that was a great offence to Dante. He said nothing, however, but
went into the blacksmith’s shop, where there were many tools of his
trade, and, seizing first the hammer, threw it into the street, then
the pincers, then the scales, and many other things of the same sort,
all which he threw into the street. The blacksmith turned round in a
brutal manner, and cried out, ‘What the devil are you doing here? Are
you mad?’ ‘Rather,’ said Dante, ‘what are <i>you</i> doing?’ ‘<i>I</i>,’ replied
the blacksmith, ‘<i>I</i> am working at my trade; and you spoil my things
by throwing them into the street.’ ‘But,’ said Dante, ‘if you do not
want to have me spoil your things, don’t spoil mine.’ ‘What do I spoil
of yours?’ said the blacksmith. ‘You sing,’ answered Dante, ‘out of my
book, but not as I wrote it; I have no other trade, and you spoil it.’
The blacksmith, in his pride and vexation, did not know what to answer;
so he gathered up his tools and went back to his work, and when he
afterward wanted to sing, he sang about Tristan and Launcelot, and let
Dante alone.”</p>

<p class="ti1">One of the stories is probably taken from the other: but
that of Don John is older, both in the date of its event and in the
time when it was recorded.</p>

in the Library at Madrid, I have, through the kindness of Professor

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_106"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_106">[106]</a></span> It seems not unlikely that Don
John Manuel intended originally to stop at the end of the twelfth tale;
at least, he there intimates such a purpose.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_107"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_107">[107]</a></span> That the general form of the
Conde Lucanor is Oriental may be seen by looking into the fables of
Bidpai, or almost any other collection of Eastern stories; the form,
I mean, of separate tales, united by some fiction common to them
all, like that of relating them all to amuse or instruct some third
person. The first appearance in Europe of such a series of tales
grouped together was in the Disciplina Clericalis; a remarkable work,
composed by Petrus Alphonsus, originally a Jew, by the name of Moses
Sephardi, born at Huesca in Aragon in 1062, and baptized as a Christian
in 1106, taking as one of his names that of Alfonso VI. of Castile,
who was his godfather. The Disciplina Clericalis, or Teaching for
Clerks or Clergymen, is a collection of thirty-seven stories, and many
apophthegms, supposed to have been given by an Arab on his death-bed
as instructions to his son. It is written in such Latin as belonged
to its age. Much of the book is plainly of Eastern origin, and some
of it is extremely coarse. It was, however, greatly admired for a
long time, and was more than once turned into French verse, as may be
seen in Barbazan (Fabliaux, ed. Méon, Paris, 1808, 8vo, Tom. II. pp.
39-183). That the Disciplina Clericalis was the prototype of the Conde
Lucanor is probable, because it was popular when the Conde Lucanor
was written; because the framework of both is similar, the stories of
both being given as counsels; because a good many of the proverbs are
the same in both; and because some of the stories in both resemble
one another, as the thirty-seventh of the Conde Lucanor, which is
the same with the first of the Disciplina. But in the tone of their
manners and civilization, there is a difference quite equal to the two
centuries that separate the two works. Through the French version, the
Disciplina Clericalis soon became known in other countries, so that we
find traces of its fictions in the “Gesta Romanorum,” the “Decameron,”
the “Canterbury Tales,” and elsewhere. But it long remained, in other
respects, a sealed book, known only to antiquaries, and was first
printed in the original Latin, from seven manuscripts in the King’s
Library, Paris, by the Société des Bibliophiles (Paris, 1824, 2 tom.
12mo). Fr. W. V. Schmidt—to whom those interested in the early history
of romantic fiction are much indebted for the various contributions
he has brought to it—published the Disciplina anew in Berlin, 1827,
4to, from a Breslau manuscript; and, what is singular for one of his
peculiar learning in this department, he supposed his own edition
to be the first. It is, on account of its curious notes, the best;
but the text of the Paris edition is to be preferred, and a very old
French prose version that accompanies it makes it as a book still more
valuable.</p>

a word which then meant <i>story</i> or <i>apologue</i>, as it does in the
Archpriest of Hita, st. 301, and in the “Crónica General.” Old Lord
Berners, in his delightful translation of Froissart, in the same way,
calls the fable of the Bird in Borrowed Plumes “an Ensample.”</p>

Don John, however, have been more indebted to him than he was to his
predecessors. Thus, the story of “Don Illan el Negromantico” (Cap. 13)
was found by Mr. Douce in two French and four English authors. (Blanco
White, Variedades, Lóndres, 1824, Tom. I. p. 310.) The apologue which
Gil Blas, when he is starving, relates to the Duke of Lerma, (Liv.
VIII. c. 6,) and “which,” he says, “he had read in Pilpay or some other
fable writer,” I sought in vain in Bidpai, and stumbled upon it, when
not seeking it, in the Conde Lucanor, Cap. 18. It may be added, that
the fable of the Swallows and the Flax (Cap. 27) is better given there
than it is in La Fontaine.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_113"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_113">[113]</a></span> Shakspeare, it is well known,
took the materials for his “Taming of the Shrew,” with little ceremony,
from a play with the same title, printed in 1594. But the story, in
its different parts, seems to have been familiar in the East from the
earliest times, and was, I suppose, found there among the traditions
of Persia by Sir John Malcolm. (Sketches of Persia, London, 1827, 8vo,
Vol. II. p. 54.) In Europe I am not aware that it can be detected
earlier than the Conde Lucanor, Cap. 45. The doctrine of unlimited
submission on the part of the wife seems, indeed, to have been a
favorite one with Don John Manuel; for, in another story, (Cap. 5,) he
says, in the very spirit of Petruchio’s jest about the sun and moon,
“If a husband says the stream runs up hill, his wife ought to believe
him, and say that it is so.”</p>

<p id="Footnote_115"><span class="label"><a

c. 5.) Argote de Molina says of such phrases, which abound in the
Conde Lucanor, that “they give a taste of the old proprieties of the
Castilian”; and elsewhere, that “they show what was the pure idiom of
our tongue.” Don John himself, with his accustomed simplicity, says, “I
have made up the book with the handsomest words I could.” (Ed. 1575,
f. 1, b.) Many of his words, however, needed explanation in the reign
of Philip the Second, and, on the whole, the phraseology of the Conde
Lucanor sounds older than that of the Partidas, which were yet written
nearly a century before it. Some of its obsolete words are purely
Latin, like <i>cras</i> for <i>to-morrow</i>, f. 83, and elsewhere.</p>

Sevilla, 1575, with a life of Don John prefixed, and a curious essay on
Castilian verse at the end,—one of the rarest books in the world; and
the other, only less rare, published at Madrid, 1642. The references in
the notes are to the first. A reprint, made, if I mistake not, from the
last, and edited by A. Keller, appeared at Stuttgard, 1839, 12mo, and a
German translation by J. von Eichendorff, at Berlin, in 1840, 12mo. Don
John Manuel, I observe, cites Arabic twice in the Conde Lucanor, (Capp.
11 and 14,)—a rare circumstance in early Spanish literature.</p>

<p id="Footnote_121"><span class="label"><a

found by the historian Diego de Mendoza among his Arabic manuscripts in
Granada, and was sent by him, with a letter dated December 1, 1573, to
Zurita, the annalist of Aragon, intimating that Argote de Molina would
be interested in it. He says truly, that “it is well worth reading, to
see with what simplicity and propriety men wrote poetical histories
in the olden times”; adding, that “it is one of those books called in
Spain <i>Gestas</i>,” and that it seems to him curious and valuable, because
he thinks it was written by a secretary of Alfonso XI., and because it
differs in several points from the received accounts of that monarch’s
reign. (Dormer, Progresos de la Historia de Aragon, Zaragoza, 1680,
fol., p. 502.) The thirty-four stanzas of this chronicle that we now
possess were first published by Argote de Molina, in his very curious
“Nobleza del Andaluzia,” (Sevilla, 1588, f. 198,) and were taken from
him by Sanchez (Poesías Anteriores, Tom. I. pp. 171-177). Argote de
Molina says, “I copy them on account of their curiosity as specimens
of the language and poetry of that age, and because they are the best
and most fluent of any thing for a long time written in Spain.” The
truth is, they are so facile, and have so few archaisms in them, that
I cannot believe they were written earlier than the ballads of the
fifteenth century, which they so much resemble. The following account
of a victory, which I once thought was that of Salado, gained in 1340,
and described in the “Crónica de Alfonso XI.,” (1551, fol., Cap. 254,)
but which I now think must have been some victory gained before 1330,
is the best part of what has been published:—</p>

was named Urraca, (st. 1550,) and belonged to the class of persons
technically called <i>Alcahuetas</i>, or “Go-betweens”; a class which, from
the seclusion of women in Spain, and perhaps from the influence of
Moorish society and manners, figures largely in the early literature
of the country, and sometimes in the later. The Partidas (Part. VII.
Tít. 22) devotes two laws to them; and the “Tragicomedia of Celestina,”
who is herself once called Trota-conventos, (end of Act. II.,) is
their chief monument. Of their activity in the days of the Archpriest
a whimsical proof is given in the extraordinary number of odious and
ridiculous names and epithets accumulated on them in st. 898-902.</p>

Isopete.” Now there were at least two collections of fables in French
in the thirteenth century, that passed under the name of Ysopet, and
are published in Robert, “Fables Inédites,” (Paris, 1825, 2 tom.
8vo); and as Marie de France, who lived at the court of Henry III.
of England, then the resort of the Northern French poets, alludes to
them in the Prologue to her own Fables, they are probably as early as
1240. (See Poésies de Marie de France, ed. Roquefort, Paris, 1820, 8vo,
Tom. II. p. 61, and the admirable discussions in De la Rue sur les
Bardes, les Jongleurs et les Trouvères, Caen, 1834, 8vo, Tom. I. pp.
198-202, and Tom. III. pp. 47-101.) To one or both of these Isopets the
Archpriest went for a part of his fables,—perhaps for all of them. Don
Juan Manuel, his contemporary, probably did the same, and sometimes
took the same fables; e. g. Conde Lucanor, Capp. 43, 26, and 49, which
are the fables of the Archpriest, stanzas 1386, 1411, and 1428.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="ti1">And so on through eight more stanzas. Now, besides the
Greek attributed to Æsop and the Latin of Horace, there can be found
above twenty versions of this fable, among which are two in Spanish,
one by Bart. Leon. de Argensola, and the other by Samaniego; but I
think the Archpriest’s is the best of the whole.</p>

<p id="Footnote_141"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_141">[141]</a></span> There are at least two
manuscripts of the poems of this Jew, from which nothing has been
published but a few poor extracts. The one commonly cited is that
of the Escurial, used by Castro, (Biblioteca Española, Tom. I. pp.
198-202,) and by Sanchez (Tom. I. pp. 179-184, and Tom. IV. p. 12,
etc.). The one I have used is in the National Library, Madrid, marked
B. b. 82, folio, in which the poem of the Rabbi is found on leaves 61
to 81. Conde, the historian of the Arabs, preferred this manuscript to
the one in the Escurial, and held the Rabbi’s true name to be given
in it, viz. <i>Santob</i>, and not <i>Santo</i>, as it is in the manuscript of
the Escurial; the latter being a name not likely to be taken by a Jew
in the time of Peter the Cruel, though very likely to be written so
by an ignorant monkish transcriber. The manuscript of Madrid begins
thus, differing from that of the Escurial, as may be seen in Castro, ut
sup.:—</p>

the middle of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class="ti1">I am aware that Don José Amador de los Rios, in his
“Estudios Históricos, Políticos y Literarios sobre los Judios de
España,” a learned and pleasant book published at Madrid in 1848, is of
a different opinion, and holds the three poems, including the Doctrina
Christiana, to be the work of Don Santo or Santob of Carrion. (See pp.
304-335.) But I think the objections to this opinion are stronger than
the reasons he gives to support it; especially the objections involved
in the following facts, viz.: that Don Santob calls himself a Jew;
that both the manuscripts of the Consejos call him a Jew; that the
Marquis of Santillana, the only tolerably early authority that mentions
him, calls him a Jew; that no one of them intimates that he ever was
converted,—a circumstance likely to have been much blazoned abroad,
if it had really occurred; and that, if he were an unconverted Jew,
it is wholly impossible he should have written the Dança General, the
Doctrina Christiana, or the Ermitaño.</p>

<p class="ti1">I ought, perhaps, to add, in reference both to the
remarks made in this note, and to the notices of the few Jewish authors
in Spanish literature generally, that I did not receive the valuable
work of Amador de los Rios till just as the present one was going to
press.</p>

200. By the kindness of Prof. Gayangos, I have a copy of the whole. To
judge from the opening lines of the poem, it was probably written in
1382:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Despues de la prima · la ora passada,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="ti1">The first of January, 1420, of the Spanish Era, when the
scene is laid, corresponds to A. D. 1382. A copy of the poem printed
at Madrid, 1848, 12mo, pp. 13, differs from my manuscript copy, but is
evidently taken from one less carefully made.</p>

<p id="Footnote_145"><span class="label"><a

near the end. It appears also in French very early, under the title of
“Le Débat du Corps et de l’Ame,” printed in 1486. (Ebert, Bib. Lexicon,
Nos. 5671-5674.) The source of the fiction has been supposed to be a
poem by a Frankish monk (Hagen und Büsching, Grundriss, Berlin, 1812,
8vo, p. 446); but it is very old, and found in many forms and many
languages. See Latin Poems attributed to Walter Mapes, and edited for
the Camden Society by T. Wright (1841, 4to, pp. 95 and 321). It was
printed in the ballad form in Spain as late as 1764.</p>

I. p. 200. Sanchez, Tom. I. pp. 182-185, with Tom. IV. p. xii. I
suspect the Spanish Dance of Death is an imitation from the French,
because I find, in several of the early editions, the French Dance of
Death is united, as the Spanish is in the manuscript of the Escurial,
with the “Débat du Corps et de l’Ame,” just as the “Vows over the
Peacock” seems, in both languages, to have been united to a poem on
Alexander.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_147"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_147">[147]</a></span> In what a vast number of forms
this strange fiction occurs may be seen in the elaborate work of F.
Douce, entitled “Dance of Death,” (London, 1833, 8vo,) and in the
“Literatur der Todtentänze,” von H. F. Massmann (Leipzig, 1840, 8vo).
To these, however, for our purpose, should be added notices from the
Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek, (Berlin, 1792, Vol. CVI. p. 279,)
and a series of prints that appeared at Lubec in 1783, folio, taken
from the paintings there, which date from 1463, and which might well
serve to illustrate the old Spanish poem. See also K. F. A. Scheller,
Bücherkunde der Sässisch-niederdeutschen Sprache, Braunschweig, 1826,
8vo, p. 75. The whole immense series, whether existing in the paintings
at Basle, Hamburg, etc., or in the old poems in all languages, one
of which is by Lydgate, were undoubtedly intended for religious
edification, just as the Spanish poem was.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_148"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_148">[148]</a></span> I have a manuscript copy of the
whole poem, made for me by Professor Gayangos, and give the following
as specimens. First, one of the stanzas translated in the text:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">A esta mi Danza traye de presente</p>
<p class="i2">Estas dos donçellas que vedes fermosas;</p>
<p class="i0">Ellas vinieron de muy mala mente</p>
<p class="i2">A oyr mis canciones que son dolorosas.</p>
<p class="i2">Mas non les valdran flores ny rosas,</p>
<p class="i0">Nin las composturas que poner solian.</p>
<p class="i0">De mi si pudiesen partir se querrian,</p>
<p class="i2">Mas non puede ser, que son mis esposas.</p>
</div></div>

<p> And the two following, which have not, I believe, been printed; the
first being the reply of Death to the Dean he had summoned, and the
last the objections of the Merchant:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

the poem,—once he is called emperor, though the Pharaoh of the period
is fully recognized; and this costly measure, made of gold and precious
stones, corresponds to the cup of the Hebrew account, and is found,
like that, in the sack of Benjamin, where it had been put by Joseph,
(after he had secretly revealed himself to Benjamin,) as the means of
seizing Benjamin and detaining him in Egypt, with his own consent, but
without giving his false brethren the reason for it.</p>

<p id="Footnote_170"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_170">[170]</a></span> Argote de Molina (Discurso sobre
la Poesía Castellana, in Conde Lucanor, 1575, f. 92) will have it that
the ballad verse of Spain is quite the same with the eight-syllable
verse in Greek, Latin, Italian, and French; “but,” he adds, “it is
properly native to Spain, in whose language it is found earlier than
in any other modern tongue, and in Spanish alone it has all the grace,
gentleness, and spirit that are more peculiar to the Spanish genius
than to any other.” The only example he cites in proof of this position
is the Odes of Ronsard,—“the most excellent Ronsard,” as he calls
him,—then at the height of his euphuistical reputation in France; but
Ronsard’s odes are miserably unlike the freedom and spirit of the
Spanish ballads. (See Odes de Ronsard, Paris, 1573, 18mo, Tom. II. pp.
62, 139.) The nearest approach that I recollect to the mere <i>measure</i>
of the ancient Spanish ballad, where there was no thought of imitating
it, is in a few of the old French Fabliaux, in Chaucer’s “House of
Fame,” and in some passages of Sir Walter Scott’s poetry. Jacob Grimm,
in his “Silva de Romances Viejos,” (Vienna, 1815, 18mo,) taken chiefly
from the collection of 1555, has printed the ballads he gives us as
if their lines were originally of fourteen or sixteen syllables; so
that one of his lines embraces two of those in the old Romanceros. His
reason was, that their epic nature and character required such long
verses, which are in fact substantially the same with those in the old
“Poem of the Cid.” But his theory, which was not generally adopted,
is sufficiently answered by V. A. Huber, in his excellent tract, “De
Primitivâ Cantilenarum Popularium Epicarum (vulgo, <i>Romances</i>) apud
Hispanos Formâ,” (Berolini, 1844, 4to,) and in his preface to his
edition of the “Chrónica del Cid,” 1844.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_171"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_171">[171]</a></span> The only suggestion I have
noticed affecting this statement is to be found in the Repertorio
Americano, (Lóndres, 1827, Tom. II. pp. 21, etc.,) where the writer,
who, I believe, is Don Andres Bello, endeavours to trace the <i>asonante</i>
to the “Vita Mathildis,” a Latin poem of the twelfth century, reprinted
by Muratori, (Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, Mediolani, 1725, fol., Tom.
V. pp. 335, etc.,) and to a manuscript Anglo-Norman poem, of the same
century, on the fabulous journey of Charlemagne to Jerusalem. But the
Latin poem is, I believe, singular in this attempt, and was, no doubt,
wholly unknown in Spain; and the Anglo-Norman poem, which has since
been published by Michel, (London, 1836, 12mo,) with curious notes,
turns out to be <i>rhymed</i>, though not carefully or regularly. Raynouard,
in the Journal des Savants, (February, 1833, p. 70,) made the same
mistake with the writer in the Repertorio; probably in consequence of
following him. The imperfect rhyme of the ancient Gaelic seems to have
been different from the Spanish <i>asonante</i>, and, at any rate, can have
had nothing to do with it. Logan’s Scottish Gael, London, 1831, 8vo,
Vol. II. p. 241.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_172"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_172">[172]</a></span> Cervantes, in his “Amante
Liberal,” calls them <i>consonancias</i> or <i>consonantes dificultosas</i>. No
doubt, their greater difficulty caused them to be less used than the
<i>asonantes</i>. Juan de la Enzina, in his little treatise on Castilian
Verse, Cap. 7, written before 1500, explains these two forms of rhyme,
and says that the old romances “no van verdaderos consonantes.” Curious
remarks on the <i>asonantes</i> are to be found in Renjifo, “Arte Poetica
Española,” (Salamanca, 1592, 4to, Cap. 34,) and the additions to it
in the edition of 1727 (4to, p. 418); to which may well be joined the
philosophical suggestions of Martinez de la Rosa, Obras, Paris, 1827,

<p id="Footnote_173"><span class="label"><a

introduced before long into the use of the <i>asonante</i>, as there had
been, in antiquity, into the use of the Greek and Latin measures, until
the sphere of the <i>asonante</i> became, as Clemencin well says, extremely
wide. Thus, <i>u</i> and <i>o</i> were held to be <i>asonante</i>, as in Ven<i>u</i>s and
Min<i>o</i>s; <i>i</i> and <i>e</i>, as in Par<i>i</i>s and mal<i>e</i>s; a diphthong with a
vowel, as gr<i>a</i>c<i>ia</i> and <i>a</i>lm<i>a</i>, c<i>ui</i>t<i>a</i>s and b<i>u</i>rl<i>a</i>s; and other
similar varieties, which, in the times of Lope de Vega and Góngora,
made the permitted combinations all but indefinite, and the composition
of <i>asonante</i> verses indefinitely easy. Don Quixote, ed. Clemencin,

specimens of ballads made from the old chronicles, but for the present
purpose I will take only a few lines from the “Crónica General,” (Parte
III. f. 77. a, ed. 1604,) where Velasquez, persuading his nephews,
the Infantes de Lara, to go against the Moors, despite of certain ill
auguries, says, “<i>Sobrinos estos agueros</i> que oystes mucho son buenos;
<i>ca nos dan a entender que ganaremos muy gran</i> algo de lo ageno, e
<i>de lo nuestro non perderemos</i>; e <i>fizol muy mal Don Nuño</i> Salido <i>en

a few lines from a spirited and well-known ballad of Góngora, which I
select, because they have been translated into <i>English asonantes</i>, by
a writer in the Retrospective Review, whose excellent version follows,
and may serve still further to explain and illustrate the measure:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="ti1 mt1">This rhyme is perfectly perceptible to any ear well
accustomed to Spanish poetry, and it must be admitted, I think, that,
when, as in the ballad cited, it embraces two of the concluding vowels
of the line, and is continued through the whole poem, the effect, even
upon a foreigner, is that of a graceful ornament, which satisfies
without fatiguing. In English, however, where our vowels have such
various powers, and where the consonants preponderate, the case is
quite different. This is plain in the following translation of the
preceding lines, made with spirit and truth, but failing to produce
the effect of the Spanish. Indeed, the rhyme can hardly be said to be
perceptible except to the eye, though the measure and its cadences are
nicely managed.</p>

in Bowring’s “Ancient Poetry of Spain” (London, 1824, 12mo, p. 107);

difference between the two languages.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_178"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_178">[178]</a></span> Speaking of the ballad verses, he
says, (Prólogo á las Rimas Humanas, Obras Sueltas, Tom. IV., Madrid,
1776, 4to, p. 176,) “I regard them as capable, not only of expressing
and setting forth any idea whatever with easy sweetness, but carrying
through <i>any</i> grave action in a versified poem.” His prediction was
fulfilled in his own time by the “Fernando” of Vera y Figueroa, a
long epic published in 1632, and in ours by the very attractive
narrative poem of Don Ángel de Saavedra, Duke de Rivas, entitled “El
Moro Exposito,” in two volumes, 1834. The example of Lope de Vega,
in the latter part of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth
centuries, no doubt did much to give currency to the <i>asonantes</i>,
which, from that time, have been more used than they were earlier.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_179"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_179">[179]</a></span> See the barbarous Latin poem
printed by Sandoval, at the end of his “Historia de los Reyes de
Castilla,” etc. (Pamplona, 1615, fol., f. 193). It is on the taking of
Almeria in 1147, and seems to have been written by an eyewitness.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_180"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_180">[180]</a></span> The authority for this is
sufficient, though the fact itself of a man being named from the sort
of poetry he composed is a singular one. It is found in Diego Ortiz de
Zuñiga, “Anales Ecclesiasticos y Seglares de Sevilla,” (Sevilla, 1677,
fol., pp. 14, 90, 815, etc.). He took it, he says, from the <i>original</i>
documents of the <i>repartimientos</i>, which he describes minutely as
having been used by Argote de Molina, (Preface and p. 815,) and from
documents in the archives of the Cathedral. The <i>repartimiento</i>, or
distribution of lands and other spoils in a city, from which, as
Mariana tells us, a hundred thousand Moors emigrated or were expelled,
was a serious matter, and the documents in relation to it seem to have
been ample and exact. (Zuñiga, Preface, and pp. 31, 62, 66, etc.) The
meaning of the word <i>Romance</i> in this place is a more doubtful matter.
But if <i>any</i> kind of popular poetry is meant by it, what was it likely
to be, at so early a period, but ballad poetry? The verses, however,
which Ortiz de Zuñiga, on the authority of Argote de Molina, attributes
(p. 815) to Domingo Abad de los Romances, are not his; they are by the
Arcipreste de Hita. See Sanchez, Tom. IV. p. 166.</p>

noche era por hilo.” Often, however, as the adventures of the Count
Claros are alluded to in the old Spanish poetry, there is no trace of
them in the old chronicles. The fragment in the text begins thus, in
the Cancionero General (1535, f. 106. a):—</p>

la Infanta,” (Romancero, 1550,) and is one of the most tender and
beautiful ballads in any language. There are translations of it by
Bowring (p. 51) and by Lockhart (Spanish Ballads, London, 1823, 4to,
p. 202). It has been at least four times brought into a dramatic
form;—viz., by Lope de Vega, in his “Fuerza Lastimosa”; by Guillen de
Castro; by Mira de Mescua; and by José J. Milanes, a poet of Havana,
whose works were printed there in 1846 (3 vols. 8vo);—the three last
giving their dramas simply the name of the ballad,—“Conde Alarcos.” The
best of them all is, I think, that of Mira de Mescua, which is found in
Vol. V. of the “Comedias Escogidas” (1653, 4to); but that of Milanes
contains passages of very passionate poetry.</p>

matters, like nearly all of his countrymen. The story of Garci Perez

<p id="Footnote_209"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_209">[209]</a></span> The ballad beginning “En Corte
del casto Alfonso,” in the ballad-book of 1555, is taken from the
“Crónica General,” (Parte III. ff. 32, 33, ed. 1604,) as the following
passage, speaking of Bernardo’s first knowledge that his father was the
Count of Saldaña, will show:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><i>Quando</i> Bernaldo <i>lo supo</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Pesóle</i> a gran demasia,</p>
<p class="i0">Tanto que <i>dentro en el cuerpo</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>La sangre se le volvia</i>.</p>
<p class="i0">Yendo <i>para su posada</i></p>
<p class="i0">Muy grande llanto hacia,</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Vistióse paños de luto</i>,</p>
<p class="i0">Y delante el Rey se iba.</p>
<p class="i0"><i>El Rey quando</i> asi <i>le vió</i>,</p>
<p class="i0">Desta suerte le decía:</p>
<p class="i0">“<i>Bernaldo</i>, por aventura</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Cobdicias la muerte mia</i>?”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti1">The Chronicle reads thus: “E el [Bernardo] <i>quandol
supo</i>, que su padre era preso, <i>pesol</i> mucho de coraçon, e <i>bolbiosele
la sangre en el cuerpo</i>, e fuesse <i>para su posada</i>, faziendo el mayor
duelo del mundo; e <i>vistióse paños de duelo</i>, e fuesse para el Rey Don
Alfonso; e <i>el Rey, quando lo vido</i>, dixol: ‘<i>Bernaldo, cobdiciades la
muerte mia?</i>’” It is plain enough, in this case, that the Chronicle
is the original of the ballad; but it is very difficult, if not
impossible, from the nature of the case, to show that any particular
ballad was used in the composition of the Chronicle, because, we have
undoubtedly none of the ballads in the form in which they existed when
the Chronicle was compiled in the middle of the thirteenth century,
and therefore a correspondence of phraseology like that just cited is
not to be expected. Yet it would not be surprising, if some of these
ballads on Bernardo, found in the Sixth Part of the “Flor de Romances,”
(Toledo, 1594, 18mo,) which Pedro Flores tells us he collected far and
wide from tradition, were known in the time of Alfonso the Wise, and
were among the Cantares de Gesta to which he alludes. I would instance
particularly the three beginning, “Contandole estaba un dia,” “Antesque
barbas tuviesse,” and “Mal mis servicios pagaste.” The language of
those ballads is, no doubt, chiefly that of the age of Charles V. and
Philip II., but the thoughts and feelings are evidently much older.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_210"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_210">[210]</a></span> Among the ballads taken from the
“Crónica General” is, I think, the one in the ballad-book of 1555,
beginning “Preso esta Fernan Gonzalez,” though the Chronicle says
(Parte III. f. 62, ed. 1604) that it was a Norman count who bribed the
castellan, and the ballad says it was a Lombard. Another, which, like
the two last, is very spirited, is found in the “Flor de Romances,”
Séptima Parte, (Alcalá, 1597, 18mo, f. 65,) beginning “El Conde Fernan
Gonzalez,” and contains an account of one of his victories over
Almanzor not told elsewhere, and therefore the more curious.</p>

1604 begins at f. 74. I possess, also, a striking volume, containing
forty plates, on their history, by Otto Vaenius, a scholar and artist,
who died in 1634. It is entitled “Historia Septem Infantium de Lara”
(Antverpiae, 1612, fol.); the same, no doubt, an imperfect copy of
which Southey praises in his notes to the “Chronicle of the Cid” (p.
401). Sepúlveda (1551-84) has a good many ballads on the subject; the
one I have partly translated in the text beginning,—</p>

(1818, 18mo,) the Frankfort, (1827, 12mo,) and the collection in Duran,
(Caballerescos, Madrid, 1832, 12mo, Tom. II. pp. 43-191,) are more
complete. The most complete of all is that by Keller, (Stuttgard, 1840,

<p class="ti1">This was one of the most popular of the old ballads.
It is often alluded to by the writers of the best age of Spanish
literature; for example, by Cervantes, in “Persiles y Sigismunda,”
(Lib. III. c. 21,) and was used by Guillen de Castro in his play on the
Cid.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_217"><span class="label"><a

ni menos Bernardo del Carpio; pero de que hicieron las hazañas que
dicen, creo que hay muy grande.” (Parte I. c. 49.) This, indeed, is the
good sense of the matter,—a point in which Cervantes rarely fails,—and
it forms a strong contrast to the extravagant faith of those who, on
the one side, consider the ballads good historical documents, as Müller
and Herder are disposed to do, and the sturdy incredulity of Masdeu, on
the other, who denies that there ever was a Cid.</p>

character is noticed by Diego Ximenez Ayllon, in his poem on that
hero, 1579, where, having spoken of his being treated by the king with
harshness,—“Tratado de su Rey con aspereza,”—the poet adds,—</p>

<p id="Footnote_226"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_226">[226]</a></span> If we choose to strike more
widely, and institute a comparison with the garrulous old Fabliaux,
or with the overdone refinements of the Troubadours and Minnesingers,
the result would be yet more in favor of the early Spanish ballads,
which represent and embody the excited poetical feeling that filled the
whole nation during that period when the Moorish power was gradually
broken down by an enthusiasm that became at last irresistible, because,
from the beginning, it was founded on a sense of loyalty and religious
duty.</p>

<p id="Footnote_228"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_228">[228]</a></span> In the code of the Partidas,
(circa A. D. 1260,) good knights are directed to listen at their meals
to the reading of “las hestorias de los grandes fechos de armas que los
otros fecieran,” etc. (Parte II. Título XXI. Ley 20.) Few knights at
that time could understand Latin, and the “<i>hestorias</i>” in Spanish must
probably have been the Chronicle now to be mentioned, and the ballads
or gestes on which it was, in part, founded.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_229"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_229">[229]</a></span> It is the opinion of Mondejar
that the original title of the “Crónica de España” was “Estoria de
España.” Memorias de Alfonso el Sabio, p. 464.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_230"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_230">[230]</a></span> The distinction Alfonso makes
between <i>ordering</i> the <i>materials</i> to be collected by others (“mandamos
ayuntar”) and <i>composing</i> or <i>compiling</i> the <i>Chronicle</i> himself
(“composimos este libro”) seems to show that he was its author or
compiler,—certainly that he claimed to be such. But there are different
opinions on this point. Florian de Ocampo, the historian, who, in 1541,
published in folio, at Zamora, the first edition of the Chronicle,
says, in notes at the end of the Third and Fourth Parts, that some
persons believe only the first three parts to have been written by
Alfonso, and the fourth to have been compiled later; an opinion to
which it is obvious that he himself inclines, though he says he will
neither affirm nor deny any thing about the matter. Others have gone
farther, and supposed the whole to have been compiled by several
different persons. But to all this it may be replied,—1. That the
Chronicle is more or less well ordered, and more or less well written,
according to the materials used in its composition; and that the
objections made to the looseness and want of finish in the Fourth Part
apply also, in a good degree, to the Third; thus proving more than
Florian de Ocampo intends, since he declares it to be certain (“sabemos
por cierto”) that the first three parts were the work of Alfonso. 2.
Alfonso declares, more than once, in his Prólogo, whose genuineness has
been made sure by Mondejar, from the four best manuscripts, that his
History comes down to his own times, (“fasta el nuestro tiempo,”)—which
we reach only at the end of the Fourth Part,—treating the whole,
throughout the Prólogo, as his own work. 3. There is strong internal
evidence that he himself wrote the last part of the work, relating to
his father; as, for instance, the beautiful account of the relations
between St. Ferdinand and his mother, Berenguela (ed. 1541, f. 404);
the solemn account of St. Ferdinand’s death, at the very end of the
whole; and other passages between ff. 402 and 426. 4. His nephew Don
John Manuel, who made an abridgment of the Crónica de España, speaks of
his uncle Alfonso the Wise as if he were its acknowledged author.</p>

<p class="ti1">It should be borne in mind, also, that Mondejar says the
edition of Florian de Ocampo is very corrupt and imperfect, omitting
whole reigns in one instance; and the passages he cites from the old
manuscripts of the entire work prove what he says. (Memorias, Lib.
VII. capp. 15, 16.) The only other edition of the Chronicle, that of
Valladolid, (fol., 1604,) is still worse. Indeed, it is, from the
number of its gross errors, one of the worst printed books I have ever
used.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_231"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_231">[231]</a></span> The statement referred to in the
Chronicle, that it was written four hundred years after the time of
Charlemagne, is, of course, a very loose one; for Alfonso was not born
in 1210. But I think he would hardly have said, “It is now full four
hundred years,” (ed. 1541, fol. 228,) if it had been full four hundred
and fifty. From this it may be inferred that the Chronicle was composed
before 1260. Other passages tend to the same conclusion. Conde, in
his Preface to his “Árabes en España,” notices the Arabic air of the
Chronicle, which, however, seems to me to have been rather the air of
its age throughout Europe.</p>

<p id="Footnote_232"><span class="label"><a

reading, especially by those who have occasion to see her story
referred to in the Spanish poets, as it is by Ercilla and Lope de Vega,
in a way quite unintelligible to those who know only the Roman version
of it as given by Virgil. It is found in the Crónica de España, (Parte
I. c. 51-57,) and ends with a very heroical epistle of the queen to
Æneas;—the Spanish view taken of the whole matter being in substance
that which is taken by Justin, very briefly, in his “Universal
History,” Lib. XVIII. c. 4-6.</p>

perhaps, so strikingly as to the stories of Bernardo del Carpio and
the Infantes de Lara, large portions of which may be found almost
verbatim in the ballads. I will now refer only to the following:—1.
On Bernardo del Carpio, the ballads beginning, “El Conde Don Sancho
Diaz,” “En corte del Casto Alfonso,” “Estando en paz y sosiego,”
“Andados treinta y seis años,” and “En gran pesar y tristeza.” 2. On
the Infantes de Lara, the ballads beginning, “A Calatrava la Vieja,”
which was evidently arranged for singing at a puppet-show or some such
exhibition, “Llegados son los Infantes,” “Quien es aquel caballero,”
and “Ruy Velasquez de Lara.” All these are found in the older
collections of ballads; those, I mean, printed before 1560; and it is
worthy of particular notice, that this same General Chronicle makes
especial mention of <i>Cantares de Gesta</i> about Bernardo del Carpio that
were known and popular when it was itself compiled, in the thirteenth
century.</p>

in the Preface to his “Chronicle of the Cid,” which, though one of
the most amusing and instructive books, in relation to the manners
and feelings of the Middle Ages, that is to be found in the English
language, is not quite so wholly a translation from its three Spanish
sources as it claims to be. The opinion of Huber on the same point is
like that of Southey.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_250"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_250">[250]</a></span> Both the chronicles cite for
their authorities the Archbishop Rodrigo of Toledo, and the Bishop
Lucas of Tuy, in Galicia, (Cid, Cap. 293; General, 1604, f. 313. b, and
elsewhere,) and represent them as dead. Now the first died in 1247,
and the last in 1250; and as the General Chronicle of Alfonso X. was
<i>necessarily</i> written between 1252 and 1282, and <i>probably</i> written
soon after 1252, it is not to be supposed, either that the Chronicle
of the Cid, or any other chronicle in the <i>Spanish</i> language which
the General Chronicle could use, was already compiled. But there are
passages in the Chronicle of the Cid which prove it to be later than
the General Chronicle. For instance, in Chapters 294, 295, and 296 of
the Chronicle of the Cid, there is a correction of an error of two
years in the General Chronicle’s chronology. And again, in the General
Chronicle, (ed. 1604, f. 313. b,) after relating the burial of the Cid,
by the bishops, in a vault, and dressed in his clothes, (“vestido con
sus paños,”) it adds, “And thus he was laid where he still lies” (“<i>E
assi yaze ay do agora yaze</i>”); but in the Chronicle of the Cid, the
words in Italics are stricken out, and we have instead, “And there he
remained a long time, till King Alfonso came to reign (“E hy estudo muy
grand tiempo, fasta que vino el Rey Don Alfonso a reynar”); after which
words we have an account of the translation of his body to another
tomb, by Alfonso the Wise, the son of Ferdinand. But, besides that
this is plainly an addition to the Chronicle of the Cid, made later
than the account given in the General Chronicle, there is a little
clumsiness about it that renders it quite curious; for, in speaking of
St. Ferdinand with the usual formulary, as “he who conquered Andalusia,
and the city of Jaen, and many other royal towns and castles,” it adds,
“As the history will relate to you <i>farther on</i> (“Segun que adelante
vos lo contará la historia”). Now the history of the Cid has nothing to
do with the history of St. Ferdinand, who lived a hundred years after
him, and is never again mentioned in this Chronicle; and therefore the
little passage containing the account of the translation of the body
of the Cid, in the thirteenth century, to its next resting-place was
probably cut out from some other chronicle which contained the history
of St. Ferdinand, as well as that of the Cid. My own conjecture is,
that it was cut out from the abridgment of the General Chronicle of
Alfonso the Wise made by his nephew Don John Manuel, who would be quite
likely to insert an addition so honorable to his uncle, when he came
to the point of the Cid’s interment; an interment of which the General
Chronicle’s account had ceased to be the true one. Cap. 291.</p>

<p class="ti1">It is a curious fact, though not one of consequence to
this inquiry, that the remains of the Cid, besides their removal by
Alfonso the Wise, in 1272, were successively transferred to different
places, in 1447, in 1541, again in the beginning of the eighteenth
century, and again, by the bad taste of the French General Thibaut,
in 1809 or 1810, until, at last, in 1824, they were restored to their
original sanctuary in San Pedro de Cardenas. Semanario Pintoresco,

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_251"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_251">[251]</a></span> If it be asked what were the
authorities on which the portion of the Crónica General relating to
the Cid relies for its materials, I should answer:—1. Those cited in
the Prólogo to the whole work by Alfonso himself, some of which are
again cited when speaking of the Cid. Among these, the most important
is the Archbishop Rodrigo’s “Historia Gothica.” (See Nic. Ant., Bibl.
Vet., Lib. VIII. c. 2, § 28.) 2. It is probable there were Arabic
records of the Cid, as a life of him, or part of a life of him, by
a nephew of Alfaxati, the converted Moor, is referred to in the
Chronicle itself, Cap. 278, and in Crón. Gen., 1541, f. 359. b. But
there is nothing in the Chronicle that sounds like Arabic, except the
“Lament for the Fall of Valencia,” beginning “Valencia, Valencia,
vinieron sobre ti muchos quebrantos,” which is on f. 329. a, and again,
poorly amplified, on f. 329. b, but out of which has been made the
fine ballad, “Apretada esta Valencia,” which can be traced back to
the ballad-book printed by Martin Nucio, at Antwerp, 1550, though, I
believe, no farther. If, therefore, there be any thing in the Chronicle
of the Cid taken from documents in the Arabic language, such documents
were written by Christians, or a Christian character was impressed on
the facts taken from them.<a id="FNanchor_251_1" href="#Footnote_251_1"
class="fnanchor">[*]</a> 3. It has been suggested by the Spanish
translators of Bouterwek, (p. 255,) that the Chronicle of the Cid in
Spanish is substantially taken from the “Historia Roderici Didaci,”
published by Risco, in “La Castilla y el mas Famoso Castellano” (1792,
App., pp. xvi.-lx.). But the Latin, though curious and valuable, is a
meagre compendium, in which I find nothing of the attractive stories
and adventures of the Spanish, but occasionally something to contradict
or discredit them. 4. the old “Poem of the Cid” was, no doubt, used,
and used freely, by the chronicler, whoever he was, though he never
alludes to it. This has been noticed by Sanchez, (Tom. I. pp. 226-228,)
and must be noticed again, in note 28, where I shall give an extract
from the Chronicle. I add here only, that it is clearly the Poem that
was used by the Chronicle, and not the Chronicle that was used by the
Poem.</p>

<p class="mt1" id="Footnote_251_1"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_251_1">[*]</a></span> Since writing this note, I learn
that my friend Don Pascual de Gayangos possesses an Arabic chronicle
that throws much light on this Spanish chronicle and on the life of the
Cid.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_252"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_252">[252]</a></span> Prohemio. The good abbot
considers the Chronicle to have been written in the lifetime of the
Cid, i. e. before A. D. 1100, and yet it refers to the Archbishop of
Toledo and the Bishop of Tuy, who were of the thirteenth century.
Moreover, he speaks of the intelligent interest the Prince Ferdinand
took in it; but Oviedo, in his Dialogue on Cardinal Ximenes, says the
young prince was only eight years and some months old when he gave the
order. Quinquagena, MS.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_253"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_253">[253]</a></span> Sometimes it is necessary earlier
to allude to a portion of the Cid’s history, and then it is added, “As
we shall relate farther on”; so that it is quite certain the Cid’s
history was originally regarded as a necessary portion of the General
Chronicle. (Crónica General, ed. 1604, Tercera Parte, f. 92. b.)
When, therefore, we come to the Fourth Part, where it really belongs,
we have, first, a chapter on the accession of Ferdinand the Great,
and then the history of the Cid connected with that of the reigns of
Ferdinand, Sancho II., and Alfonso VI.; but the whole is so truly an
integral part of the General Chronicle and not a separate chronicle of
the Cid, that, when it was taken out to serve as a separate chronicle,
it was taken out as <i>the three reigns</i> of the three sovereigns above
mentioned, beginning with one chapter that goes back ten years before
the Cid was born, and ending with five chapters that run forward ten
years after his death; while, at the conclusion of the whole, is a
sort of colophon, apologizing (Chrónica del Cid, Burgos, 1593, fol.,
f. 277) for the fact that it is so much a chronicle of these three
kings, rather than a mere chronicle of the Cid. This, with the peculiar
character of the differences between the two that have been already
noticed, has satisfied me that the Chronicle of the Cid was taken from
the General Chronicle.</p>

href="#FNanchor_254">[254]</a></span> Masdeu (Historia Crítica de
España, Madrid, 1783-1805, 4to, Tom. XX.) would have us believe that
the whole is a fable; but this demands too much credulity. The question
is discussed with acuteness and learning in “Jos. Aschbach de Cidi
Historiæ Fontibus Dissertatio,” (Bonnæ, 4to, 1843, pp. 5, etc.,) but
little can be settled about individual facts.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_255"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_255">[255]</a></span> The portion of the Chronicle
of the Cid from which I have taken the extract is among the portions
which least resemble the corresponding parts of the General Chronicle.
It is in Chap. 91; and from Chap. 88 to Chap. 93 there is a good deal
not found in the parallel passages in the General Chronicle, (1604, f.
224, etc.,) though, where they do resemble each other, the phraseology
is still frequently identical. The particular passage I have selected
was, I think, suggested by the first lines that remain to us of the
“Poema del Cid”; and perhaps, if we had the preceding lines of that
poem, we should be able to account for yet more of the additions to the
Chronicle in this passage. The lines I refer to are as follows:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">De los sos oios tan fuertes · mientre lorando</p>
<p class="i0">Tornaba la cabeza, · e estabalos catando.</p>
<p class="i0">Vio puertas abiertas · e uzos sin cañados,</p>
<p class="i0">Alcándaras vacias, · sin pielles e sin mantos,</p>
<p class="i0">E sin falcones e sin · adtores mudados.</p>
<p class="i0">Sospiró mio Cid, ca · mucho avie grandes cuidados.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti1">Other passages are quite as obviously taken from the
poem.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_256"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_256">[256]</a></span> It sounds much like the
“Partidas,” beginning, “Los sabios antiguos que fueron en los tiempos
primeros, y fallaron los saberes y las otras cosas, tovieron que
menguarien en sus fechos y en su lealtad, si tambien no lo quisiessen
para los otros que avien de venir, como para si mesmos o por los otros
que eran en su tiempo,” etc. But such introductions are common in other
early chronicles, and in other old Spanish books.</p>

<p id="Footnote_268"><span class="label"><a

or caused to be translated, all these books. At least, such has been
the impression; and the mention of Isidore of Seville among the authors
“made known” seems to justify it, for, as a Spaniard of great fame,
St. Isidore must always have been <i>known</i> in Spain in every other
way, except by a translation into Spanish. See, also, the Preface to
the edition of Boccaccio, Caída de Príncipes, 1495, in Fr. Mendez,
Typografía Española, Madrid, 1796, 4to, p. 202.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_269"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_269">[269]</a></span> The first edition of Ayala’s
Chronicles is of Seville, 1495, folio, but it seems to have been
printed from a MS. that did not contain the entire series. The best
edition is that published under the auspices of the Academy of History,
by D. Eugenio de Llaguno Amirola, its secretary (Madrid, 1779, 2 tom.
4to). That Ayala was the authorized chronicler of Castile is apparent
from the whole tone of his work, and is directly asserted in an old MS.
of a part of it, cited by Bayer in his notes to N. Antonio, Bib. Vet.,

<p id="Footnote_270"><span class="label"><a

<p id="Footnote_272"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_272">[272]</a></span> The fairness of Ayala in regard
to Don Pedro has been questioned, and, from his relations to that
monarch, may naturally be suspected;—a point on which Mariana touches,
(Historia, Lib. XVII. c. 10,) without settling it, but one of some
little consequence in Spanish literary history, where the character
of Don Pedro often appears connected with poetry and the drama. The
first person who attacked Ayala was, I believe, Pedro de Gracia Dei, a
courtier in the time of Ferdinand and Isabella and in that of Charles
V. He was King-at-Arms and Chronicler to the Catholic sovereigns, and
I have, in manuscript, a collection of his professional <i>coplas</i> on
the lineages and arms of the principal families of Spain, and on the
general history of the country;—short poems, worthless as verse, and
sneered at by Argote de Molina, in the Preface to his “Nobleza del
Andaluzia,” (1588,) for the imperfect knowledge their author had of the
subjects on which he treated. His defence of Don Pedro is not better.
It is found in the Seminario Erudito, (Madrid, 1790, Tom. XXVIII. and
XXIX.,) with additions by a later hand, probably Diego de Castilla,
Dean of Toledo, who, I believe, was one of Don Pedro’s descendants.
It cites no sufficient authorities for the averments which it makes
about events that happened a century and a half earlier, and on
which, therefore, it was unsuitable to trust the voice of tradition.
Francisco de Castilla, who certainly had blood of Don Pedro in his
veins, followed in the same track, and speaks, in his “Pratica de las
Virtudes,” (Çaragoça, 1552, 4to, fol. 28,) of the monarch and of Ayala
as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">El gran rey Don Pedro, quel vulgo reprueva</p>
<p class="i0">Por selle enemigo, quien hizo su historia, etc.</p>
</div></div>

<p>All this, however, produced little effect. But, in process of
time, books were written upon the question;—the “Apologia del Rey Don
Pedro,” by Ledo del Pozo, (Madrid, folio, s. a.,) and “El Rey Don Pedro
defendido,” (Madrid, 1648, 4to,) by Vera y Figueroa, the diplomatist of
the reign of Philip IV.; works intended, apparently, only to flatter
the pretensions of royalty, but whose consequences we shall find when
we come to the “Valiente Justiciero” of Moreto, Calderon’s “Médico de
su Honra,” and similar poetical delineations of Pedro’s character in
the seventeenth century. The ballads, however, it should be noticed,
are almost always true to the view of Pedro given by Ayala;—the most
striking exception that I remember being the admirable ballad beginning
“A los pies de Don Enrique,” Quinta Parte de Flor de Romances,
recopilado por Sebastian Velez de Guevara, Burgos, 1594, 18mo.</p>

of Rodriguez del Padron is found in the Cancioneros Generales; and of
Diego de Valera there is “La Crónica de España abreviada por Mandado
de la muy Poderosa Señora Doña Isabel, Reyna de Castilla,” made in
1481, when its author was sixty-nine years old, and printed, 1482,
1493, 1495, etc.,—a chronicle of considerable merit for its style, and
of some value, notwithstanding it is a compendium, for the original
materials it contains towards the end, such as two eloquent and bold
letters by Valera himself to John II., on the troubles of the time,
and an account of what he personally saw of the last days of the Great
Constable, (Parte IV. c. 125,)—the last and the most important chapter
in the book. (Mendez, p. 138. Capmany, Eloquencia Española, Madrid,
1786, 8vo, Tom. I. p. 180.) It should be added, that the editor of the
Chronicle of John II. (1779) thinks Valera was the person who finally
arranged and settled that Chronicle; but the opinion of Carvajal
seems the more probable. Certainly, I hope Valera had no hand in the
praise bestowed on himself in the excellent story told of him in the
Chronicle, (Ann. 1437, Cap. 3,) showing how, in presence of the king
of Bohemia, at Prague, he defended the honor of his liege lord, the
king of Castile. A treatise of a few pages on Providence, by Diego de
Valera, printed in the edition of the “Vision Deleytable,” of 1489, and
reprinted, almost entire, in the first volume of Capmany’s “Eloquencia
Española,” is worth reading, as a specimen of the grave didactic prose
of the fifteenth century. A Chronicle of Ferdinand and Isabella, by
Valera, which may well have been the best and most important of his
works, has never been printed. Gerónimo Gudiel, Compendio de Algunas

responsible for the style and general character of the Chronicle.
“Cogió de cada uno lo que le pareció mas probable, y abrevió algunas
cosas, tomando la sustancia dellas; porque así creyó que convenia.”

<p id="Footnote_285"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_285">[285]</a></span> This Chronicle affords us, in
one place that I have noticed,—probably not the only one,—a curious
instance of the way in which the whole class of Spanish chronicles to
which it belongs were sometimes used in the poetry of the old ballads
we so much admire. The instance to which I refer is to be found in the
account of the leading event of the time, the violent death of the
Great Constable Alvaro de Luna, which the fine ballad beginning “Un
Miercoles de mañana” takes plainly from this Chronicle of John II.
The two are worth comparing throughout, and their coincidences can be
properly felt only when this is done; but a little specimen may serve
to show how curious is the whole.</p>

<p class="ti1">The Chronicle (Anno 1453, Cap. 2) has it as follows:—“E
vidó a Barrasa, Caballerizo del Principe, e llamóle é dixóle: ‘Ven acá,
Barrasa, tu estas aqui mirando la muerte que me dan. Yo te ruego, que
digas al Principe mi Señor, que dé mejor gualardon a sus criados, quel
Rey mi Señor mandó dar á mi.’”</p>

<p class="ti1">The ballad, which is cited as anonymous by Duran, but
is found in Sepúlveda’s Romances, etc., 1584, (f. 204,) though not in
the edition of 1551, gives the same striking circumstance, a little
amplified, in these words:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Y vido estar a Barrasa,</p>
<p class="i0">Que al Principe le servia,</p>
<p class="i0">De ser su cavallerizo,</p>
<p class="i0">Y vino a ver aquel dia</p>
<p class="i0">A executar la justicia,</p>
<p class="i0">Que el maestre recebia:</p>
<p class="i0">“Ven aca, hermano Barrasa,</p>
<p class="i0">Di al Principe por tu vida,</p>
<p class="i0">Que de mejor galardon</p>
<p class="i0">A quien sirve a su señoria,</p>
<p class="i0">Que no el, que el Rey mi Señor</p>
<p class="i0">Me ha mandado dar este dia.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti1">So near do the old Spanish chronicles often come to
being poetry, and so near do the old Spanish ballads often come to
being history. But the Chronicle of John II. is, I think, the last to
which this remark can be applied.</p>

<p class="ti1">If I felt sure of the genuineness of the “Centon
Epistolario” of Gomez de Cibdareal, I should here cite the one hundred
and third Letter as the material from which the Chronicle’s account was
constructed.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_286"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_286">[286]</a></span> When the first edition of
Castillo’s Chronicle was published I do not know. It is treated as if
still only in manuscript by Mondejar in 1746 (Advertencias, p. 112);
by Bayer, in his notes to Nic. Antonio, (Bib. Vetus, Vol. II. p. 349,)
which, though written a little earlier, were published in 1788; and by
Ochoa, in the notes to the inedited poems of the Marquis of Santillana,
(Paris, 1844, 8vo, p. 397,) and in his “Manuscritos Españoles” (1844,
p. 92, etc.). The very good edition, however, prepared by Josef Miguel
de Flores, published in Madrid, by Sancha, (1787, 4to,) as a part of
the Academy’s collection, is announced, on its title-page, as the
<i>second</i>. If these learned men have all been mistaken on such a point,
it is very strange.</p>

<p id="Footnote_287"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_287">[287]</a></span> For the use of a manuscript copy
of Palencia’s Chronicle I am indebted to my friend, W. H. Prescott,
Esq., who notices it among the materials for his “Ferdinand and
Isabella,” (Vol. I. p. 136, Amer. ed.,) with his accustomed acuteness.
A full life of Palencia is to be found in Juan Pellicer, Bib. de
Traductores, (Madrid, 1778, 4to,) Second Part, pp. 7-12.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_288"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_288">[288]</a></span> I owe my knowledge of this
manuscript, also, to my friend Mr. Prescott, whose copy I have used.
It consists of one hundred and forty-four chapters, and the credulity
and bigotry of its author, as well as his better qualities, may be seen
in his accounts of the Sicilian Vespers, (Cap. 193,) of the Canary
Islands, (Cap. 64,) of the earthquake of 1504, (Cap. 200,) and of the
election of Leo X. (Cap. 239). Of his prejudice and partiality, his
version of the bold visit of the great Marquis of Cadiz to Isabella,
(Cap. 29,) when compared with Mr. Prescott’s notice of it, (Part I.
Chap. 6,) will give an idea; and of his intolerance, the chapters
(110-114) about the Jews afford proof even beyond what might be
expected from his age. There is an imperfect article about Bernaldez in
N. Antonio, Bib. Nov., but the best materials for his life are in the
egotism of his own Chronicle.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_289"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_289">[289]</a></span> The chapters about Columbus are
118-131. The account of Columbus’s visit to him is in Cap. 131, and
that of the manuscripts intrusted to him is in Cap. 123. He says, that,
when Columbus came to court in 1496, he was dressed as a Franciscan
monk, and wore the cord <i>por devocion</i>. He cites Sir John Mandeville’s
Travels, and seems to have read them (Cap. 123); a fact of some
significance, when we bear in mind his connection with Columbus.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_290"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_290">[290]</a></span> A notice of him is prefixed to
his “Claros Varones” (Madrid, 1775, 4to); but it is not much. We know
from himself that he was an old man in 1490.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_291"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_291">[291]</a></span> The first edition of his
Chronicle, published by an accident, as if it were the work of the
famous Antonio de Lebrija, appeared in 1565, at Valladolid. But
the error was soon discovered, and in 1567 it was printed anew, at
Saragossa, with its true author’s name. The only other edition of it,
and by far the best of the three, is the beautiful one, Valencia,
1780, folio. See the Prólogo to this edition for the mistake by which
Pulgar’s Chronicle was attributed to Lebrija.</p>

<p id="Footnote_292"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_292">[292]</a></span> Read, for instance, the long
speech of Gomez Manrique to the inhabitants of Toledo. (Parte II.
c. 79.) It is one of the best, and has a good deal of merit as an
oratorical composition, though its Roman tone is misplaced in such a
chronicle. It is a mistake, however, in the publisher of the edition
of 1780 to suppose that Pulgar first introduced these formal speeches
into the Spanish. They occur, as has been already observed, in the
Chronicles of Ayala, eighty or ninety years earlier.</p>

Juan el IIº,” (ad Ann. 1433, Cap. 5,) and in Zurita, “Anales de Aragon”
(Lib. XIV. c. 22). The book itself, “El Passo Honroso,” was prepared
on the spot, at Orbigo, by Delena, one of the authorized scribes of
John II.; and was abridged by Fr. Juan de Pineda, and published at
Salamanca, in 1588, and again at Madrid, under the auspices of the
Academy of History, in 1783 (4to). Large portions of the original are
preserved in it verbatim, as in sections 1, 4, 7, 14, 74, 75, etc. In
other parts, it seems to have been disfigured by Pineda. (Pellicer,
note to Don Quixote, Parte I. c. 49.) The poem of “Esvero y Almedora,”
in twelve cantos, by D. Juan María Maury, (Paris, 1840, 12mo,) is
founded on the adventures recorded in this Chronicle, and so is the
“Passo Honroso,” by Don Ángel de Saavedra, Duque de Rivas, in four
cantos, in the second volume of his Works (Madrid, 1820-21, 2 tom.
12mo).</p>

Capp. 3 and 8; 1436, Cap. 4.) Indeed, the Chronicle is full of them;

who, however, has omitted a good deal of what he calls “fábulas
caballerescas.” Instances of such omissions occur in Parte I. c. 15,
Parte II. c. 18, 40, etc., and I cannot but think Don Eugenio would

Constable’s descendants, but, notwithstanding its value and interest,
only one edition has been published since,—that by Flores, the diligent
Secretary of the Academy of History (Madrid, 1784, 4to). “Privado del
Rey” was the common style of Alvaro de Luna;—“Tan privado,” as Manrique
calls him;—a word which almost became English, for Lord Bacon, in
his twenty-seventh Essay, says, “The modern languages give unto such
persons the names of <i>favorites</i> or <i>privadoes</i>.”</p>

Pulgars—one called Hernan Perez del Pulgar, and the other Fernando del
Pulgar—seems to have been made while they were both alive. At least, I
so infer from the following good-humored passage in a letter from the
latter to his correspondent, Pedro de Toledo: “E pues quereis saber
como me aveis de llamar, sabed, Señor, que me llaman Fernando, e me
llamaban e llamaran Fernando, e si me dan el Maestrazgo de Santiago,
tambien Fernando,” etc. (Letra XII., Madrid, 1775, 4to, p. 153.) For
the mistakes made concerning them in more modern times, see Nic.
Antonio, (Bib. Nova, Tom. I. p. 387,) who seems to be sadly confused
about the whole matter.</p>

be the first edition, because, in the <i>licencia</i>, it is said to be
printed, “porque hay falta de ellas.” It contains some of the family
documents that are found in Pulgar’s account of him, and was reprinted
at least twice afterwards, viz., Sevilla, 1582, and Alcalá, 1584.</p>

<p id="Footnote_318"><span class="label"><a

admiring sovereigns to have his burial-place where he knelt when he
affixed the Ave Maria to the door of the mosque, and his descendants
still preserve his tomb there with becoming reverence, and still
occupy the most distinguished place in the choir of the cathedral,
which was originally granted to him and to his heirs male in right
line. (Alcántara, Historia de Granada, Granada, 1846, 8vo, Tom. IV.,
p. 102; and the curious documents collected by Martinez de la Rosa in
his “Hernan Perez del Pulgar,” pp. 279-283, for which see next note.)
The oldest play known to me on the subject of Hernan Perez del Pulgar’s
achievement is “El Cerco de Santa Fe,” in the first volume of Lope
de Vega’s “Comedias” (Valladolid, 1604, 4to). But the one commonly
represented is by an unknown author, and founded on Lope’s. It is
called “El Triunfo del Ave Maria,” and is said to be “de un Ingenio de
este Corte,” dating probably from the reign of Philip IV. My copy of it
is printed in 1793. Martinez de la Rosa speaks of seeing it, and of the
strong impression it produced on his youthful imagination.</p>

entitled “Hernan Perez del Pulgar,” 1834, 8vo, edited by D. Fr.
Martinez de la Rosa, with a pleasant Life of Pulgar and valuable notes,

<p id="Footnote_341"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_341">[341]</a></span> To those who wish to know more
of Columbus as a writer than can be properly sought in a classical
life of him like that of Irving, I commend as precious: 1. The account
of his first voyage, addressed to his sovereigns, with the letter
to Rafael Sanchez on the same subject (Navarrete, Col., Tom. I. pp.
1-197); the first document being extant only in an abstract, which
contains, however, large extracts from the original made by Las Casas,
and of which a very good translation appeared at Boston, 1827 (8vo).
Nothing is more remarkable, in the tone of these narratives, than the
devout spirit that constantly breaks forth. 2. The account, by Columbus
himself, of his third voyage, in a letter to his sovereigns and in
a letter to the nurse of Prince John; the first containing several
interesting passages showing that he had a love for the beautiful in
nature. (Navarrete, Col., Tom. I. pp. 242-276.) 3. The letter to the
sovereigns about his fourth and last voyage, which contains the account
of his vision at Veragua. (Navarrete, Col., Tom. I. pp. 296-312.) 4.
Fifteen miscellaneous letters. (Ibid., Tom. I. pp. 330-352.) 5. His
speculations about the prophecies, (Tom. II. pp. 260-273,) and his
letter to the Pope (Tom. II. pp. 280-282). But whoever would speak
worthily of Columbus, or know what was most noble and elevated in his
character, will be guilty of an unhappy neglect, if he fails to read
the discussions about him by Alexander von Humboldt; especially those
in the “Examen Critique de l’Histoire de la Géographie du Nouveau
Continent,” (Paris, 1836-38, 8vo, Vol. II. pp. 350, etc., Vol. III. pp.
227-262,)—a book no less remarkable for the vastness of its views than
for the minute accuracy of its learning on some of the most obscure
subjects of historical inquiry. Nobody has comprehended the character
of Columbus as he has,—its generosity, its enthusiasm, its far-reaching
visions, which seemed watching beforehand for the great scientific
discoveries of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p id="Footnote_350"><span class="label"><a

transformations the same ideas can be made to pass, it may be worth
while to compare, in the “Crónica General,” 1604, (Parte III. f. 6,)
the original account of the famous battle of Covadonga, where the
Archbishop Orpas is represented picturesquely coming upon his mule
to the cave in which Pelayo and his people lay, with the tame and
elaborate account evidently taken from it in this Chronicle of Roderic
(Parte II. c. 196); then with the account in Mariana, (Historia,
Lib. VII. c. 2,) where it is polished down into a sort of dramatized
history; and, finally, with Southey’s “Roderic, the Last of the Goths,”
(Canto XXIII.,) where it is again wrought up to poetry and romance. It
is an admirable scene both for chronicling narrative and for poetical
fiction to deal with; but Alfonso the Wise and Southey have much the
best of it, while a comparison of the four will at once give the poor
“Chronicle of Roderic or the Destruction of Spain” its true place.</p>

<p class="ti1">Another work, something like this Chronicle, but still
more worthless, was published, in two parts, in 1592-1600, and seven or
eight times afterwards; thus giving proof that it long enjoyed a degree
of favor to which it was little entitled. It was written by Miguel de
Luna, in 1589, as appears by a note to the first part, and is called
“Verdadera Historia del Rey Rodrigo, con la Perdida de España, y Vida
del Rey Jacob Almanzor, traduzida de Lengua Arábiga,” etc., my copy
being printed at Valencia, 1606, 4to. Southey, in his notes to his
“Roderic,” (Canto IV.,) is disposed to regard this work as an authentic
history of the invasion and conquest of Spain, coming down to the year
of Christ 761, and written in the original Arabic only two years later.
But this is a mistake. It is a bold and scandalous forgery, with even
less merit in its style than the elder Chronicle on the same subject,
and without any of the really romantic adventures that sometimes give
an interest to that singular work, half monkish, half chivalrous.
How Miguel de Luna, who, though a Christian, was of an old Moorish
family in Granada, and an interpreter of Philip II., should have shown
a great ignorance of the Arabic language and history of Spain, or,
showing it, should yet have succeeded in passing off his miserable
stories as authentic, is certainly a singular circumstance. That such,
however, is the fact, Conde, in his “Historia de la Dominacion de los
Arabes,” (Preface, p. x.,) and Gayangos, in his “Mohammedan Dynasties
of Spain,” (Vol. I. p. viii.,) leave no doubt,—the latter citing it
as a proof of the utter contempt and neglect into which the study of
Arabic literature had fallen in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_351"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_351">[351]</a></span> Two Spanish translations of
chronicles should be here remembered; one for its style and author, and
the other for its subject.</p>

<p class="ti1">The first is the “Universal Chronicle” of Felipe
Foresto, a modest monk of Bergamo, who refused the higher honors of
his Church, in order to be able to devote his life to letters, and who
died in 1520, at the age of eighty-six. He published, in 1486, his
large Latin Chronicle, entitled “Supplementum Chronicarum”;—meaning
rather a chronicle intended to supply all needful historical knowledge,
than one that should be regarded as a supplement to other similar
works. It was so much esteemed at the time, that its author saw it
pass through ten editions; and it is said to be still of some value
for facts stated nowhere so well as on his personal authority. At the
request of Luis Carroz and Pedro Boyl, it was translated into Spanish
by Narcis Viñoles, the Valencian poet, known in the old Cancioneros
for his compositions both in his native dialect and in Castilian. An
earlier version of it into Italian, published in 1491, may also have
been the work of Viñoles, since he intimates that he had made one; but
his Castilian version was printed at Valencia, in 1510, with a license
from Ferdinand the Catholic, acting for his daughter Joan. It is a
large book, of nearly nine hundred pages, in folio, entitled, “Suma de
todas las Crónicas del Mundo,” and though Viñoles hints it was a rash
thing in him to write in Castilian, his style is good and sometimes
gives an interest to his otherwise dry annals. Ximeno, Bib. Val., Tom.
I. p. 61. Fuster, Tom. I. p. 54. Diana Enam. de Polo, ed. 1802, p. 304.

<p class="ti1">The other Chronicle referred to is that of St. Louis, by
his faithful follower Joinville; the most picturesque of the monuments
for the French language and literature of the thirteenth century. It
was translated into Spanish by Jacques Ledel, one of the suite of the
French Princess Isabel de Bourbon, when she went to Spain to become the
wife of Philip II. Regarded as the work of a foreigner, the version is
respectable; and though it was not printed till 1567, yet its whole
tone prevents it from finding an appropriate place anywhere except in
the period of the old Castilian chronicles. Crónica de San Luis, etc.,
traducida por Jacques Ledel, Madrid, 1794, folio.</p>

earlier than 1510, and this one uncertain. But “Tirant lo Blanch” was
printed in 1490, in the Valencian dialect, and the Amadis appeared
perhaps soon afterwards, in the Castilian; so that it is not improbable
the “Chronicle of Don Roderic” may mark, by the time of its appearance,
as well as by its contents and spirit, the change, of which it is
certainly a very curious monument.</p>

of his “Chronicle of the Conde Don Pedro de Meneses,” says that he
wishes to write an account only of “the things that happened in his

he could have true knowledge of them.” This strengthens what he says
concerning Lobeira, in the passage cited in the text from the opening
of Chap. 63 of the Chronicle. The Ferdinand to whom Zurara there refers
was the father of John I. and died in 1383. The Chronicle of Zurara
is published by the Academy of Lisbon, in their “Colecção de Libros
Ineditos de Historia Portuguesa,” Lisboa, 1792, fol., Tom. II. I have
a curious manuscript “Dissertation on the Authorship of the Amadis
de Gaula,” by Father Sarmiento, who wrote the valuable fragment of a
History of Spanish Poetry to which I have often referred. This learned
Galician is much confused and vexed by the question;—first denying that
there is any authority at all for saying Lobeira wrote the Amadis;
then asserting, that, <i>if</i> Lobeira wrote it, he was a Galician; then
successively suggesting that it may have been written by Vasco Perez
de Camões, by the Chancellor Ayala, by Montalvo, or by the Bishop of
Cartagena;—all absurd conjectures, much connected with his prevailing

Arthur himself—“El muy virtuoso rey Artur”—is spoken of in Lib. I. c.
1, and in Lib. IV. c. 49, where “the Book of Don Tristan and Launcelot”

de Lobeira, which Southey, in his Preface to his “Amadis of Gaul,”
(London, 1803, 12mo, Vol. I. p. vii.,) erroneously attributes to the
Infante Antonio of Portugal, and thus would make it of consequence
in the present discussion. Nic. Antonio, who leaves no doubt as to
the authorship of the sonnet in question, refers to the same note in
Ferreira to prove the deposit of the manuscript of the Amadis; so that
the two constitute only <i>one</i> authority, and not <i>two</i> authorities, as
Southey supposes. (Bib. Vetus, Lib. VIII. cap. vii. sect. 291.) Barbosa
is more distinct. (Bib. Lusitana, Tom. III. p. 775.) But there is a
careful summing up of the matter in Clemencin’s notes to Don Quixote,

Cervantes, however, is mistaken in his bibliography, when he says that
the Amadis was the <i>first</i> book of chivalry printed in Spain. It has
often been noted that this distinction belongs to “Tirant lo Blanch,”
1490; though Southey (Omniana, London, 1812, 12mo, Tom. II. p. 219)
thinks “there is a total want of the spirit of chivalry” in it; and it
should further be noted now, as curious facts, that “Tirant lo Blanch,”
though it appeared in Valencian in 1490, in Castilian in 1511, and
in Italian in 1538, was yet, like the Amadis, originally written in
Portuguese, to please a Portuguese prince, and that this Portuguese
original is now lost;—all remarkable coincidences. See note on Chap.
XVII. of this Period. On the point of the general merits of the Amadis,
two opinions are worth citing. The first, on its style, is by the
severe anonymous author of the “Diálogo de las Lenguas,” temp. Charles
V., who, after discussing the general character of the book, adds, “It
should be read by those who wish to learn our language.” (Mayans y
Siscar, Orígenes, Madrid, 1737, 12mo, Tom. II. p. 163.) The other, on
its invention and story, is by Torquato Tasso, who says of the Amadis,
“In the opinion of many, and particularly in my own opinion, it is the
most beautiful, and perhaps the most profitable, story of its kind that
can be read, because, in its sentiment and tone, it leaves all others
behind it, and, in the variety of its incidents, yields to none written
before or since.” Apologia della Gerusalemme, Opere, Pisa, 1824, 8vo,

<p id="Footnote_378"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_378">[378]</a></span> I possess of “Esplandian” the
curious edition printed at Burgos, in folio, double columns, 1587, by
Simon de Aguaya. It fills 136 leaves, and is divided into 184 chapters.
As in the other editions I have seen mentioned or have noticed in
public libraries, it is called “<i>Las Sergas</i> del muy Esforçado
Cavallero Esplandian,” in order to give it the learned appearance of
having really been translated, as it pretends to be, from the Greek
of Master Elisabad;—“Sergas” being evidently an awkward corruption
of the Greek Ἔργα, <i>works</i> or <i>achievements</i>. Allusions are made to
it, as to a continuation, in the Amadis, Lib. IV.; besides which, in
Lib. III. cap. 4, we have the birth and baptism of Esplandian; in Lib.
III. c. 8, his marvellous growth and progress; and so on, till, in
the last chapter of the romance, he is armed as a knight. So that the
Esplandian is, in the strictest manner, a continuation of the Amadis.
Southey (Omniana, Vol. I. p. 145) thinks there is some error about
the authorship of the Esplandian. If there is, I think it is merely
typographical.</p>

<p id="Footnote_380"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_380">[380]</a></span> The whole subject of these twelve
books of Amadis in Spanish and the twenty-four in French belongs
rather to bibliography than to literary history, and is among the most
obscure points in both. The twelve Spanish books are said by Brunet
never to have been all seen by any one bibliographer. I have seen, I
believe, seven or eight of them, and own the only two for which any
real value has ever been claimed,—the Amadis de Gaula, in the rare
and well-printed edition of Venice, 1533, folio, and the Esplandian
in the more rare, but very coarse, edition already referred to. When
the earliest edition of either of them, or of most of the others, was
printed cannot, I presume, be determined. One of Esplandian, of 1510,
is mentioned by N. Antonio, but by nobody else in the century and a
half that have since elapsed; and he is so inaccurate in such matters,
that his authority is not sufficient. In the same way, he is the only
authority for an edition in 1525 of the seventh book,—“Lisuarte of
Greece.” But, as the twelfth book was certainly printed in 1549, the
only fact of much importance is settled; viz., that the whole twelve
were published in Spain in the course of about half a century. For all
the curious learning on the subject, however, see an article by Salvá,
in the Repertorio Americano, Lóndres, Agosto de 1827, pp. 29-39; F.
A. Ebert, Lexicon, Leipzig, 1821, 4to, Nos. 479-489; Brunet, article
<i>Amadis</i>; and, especially, the remarkable discussion, already referred
to, by F. W. V. Schmidt, in the Wiener Jahrbücher, Band XXXIII.

<p id="Footnote_382"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_382">[382]</a></span> The fate of Palmerin of England
has been a very strange one. Until a few years since, the only
question was, whether it were originally French or Portuguese; for the
oldest forms in which it was then known to exist were, 1. the French
by Jacques Vicent, 1553, and the Italian by Mambrino Roseo, 1555,
both of which claimed to be translations from the Spanish; and, 2.
the Portuguese by Moraes, 1567, which claimed to be translated from
the French. In general, it was supposed to be the work of Moraes,
who, having long lived in France, was thought to have furnished his
manuscript to the French translator, (Barbosa, Bib. Lus., Tom. II.
p. 209,) and, under this persuasion, it was published as his, in
Portuguese, at Lisbon, in three handsome volumes, small 4to, 1786, and
in English, by Southey, London, 1807, 4 vols. 12mo. Even Clemencin,
(ed. Don Quixote, Tom. I. pp. 125, 126,) if he did not think it to be
the work of Moraes, had no doubt that it was originally Portuguese. At
last, however, Salvá found a copy of the lost Spanish original, which
settles the question, and places the date of the work in 1547-48,
Toledo, 3 tom. folio. (Repertorio Americano, Tom. IV. pp. 42-46.) The
little we know of its author, Luis Hurtado, is to be found in Antonio,
Bib. Nov., Tom. II. p. 44, where one of his works, “Cortes del Casto
Amor y de la Muerte,” is said to have been printed in 1557. He also
translated the “Metamorphoses” of Ovid.</p>

well-known author of the “Carolea,” a long poem printed in that year.
But to him is not attributed the “Caballería Celestial”; nor does any
other Hierónimo de San Pedro occur in these collections of lives,

of “Celestina” by De Lavigne (Paris, 12mo, 1841, pp. v., vi.). But
their adventures, taken from Pamphylus Maurianus, already noticed,
(p. 81,) constitute, in fact, a mere story arranged about 1335, by
the Archpriest of Hita, out of an old Latin dialogue, (Sanchez, Tom.
IV. stanz. 550-865,) but differing in nothing important from the
other tales of the Archpriest, and quite insusceptible of dramatic
representation. (See Preface of Sanchez to the same volume, pp. xxiii.,
etc.) 2. The “Dança General de la Muerte,” already noticed as written
about 1350, (Castro, Biblioteca Española, Tom. I. pp. 200, etc.,) has
been cited by L. F. Moratin (Obras, ed. de la Academia, Madrid, 1830,
8vo, Tom. I. p. 112) as the earliest specimen of Spanish dramatic
literature. But it is unquestionably not a drama, but a didactic poem,
which it would have been quite absurd to attempt to exhibit. 3. The
“Comedieta de Ponza,” on the great naval battle fought near the island
of Ponza, in 1435, and written by the Marquis of Santillana, who died
in 1454, has been referred to as a drama by Martinez de la Rosa, (Obras
Literarias, Paris, 1827, 12mo, Tom. II. pp. 518, etc.,) who assigns it
to about 1436. But it is, in truth, merely an allegorical poem thrown
into the form of a dialogue and written in <i>coplas de arte mayor</i>. I
shall notice it hereafter. And finally, 4. Blas de Nasarre, in his
Prólogo to the plays of Cervantes, (Madrid, 1749, 4to, Vol. I.,) says
there was a <i>comedia</i> acted before Ferdinand and Isabella in 1469, at
the house of the Count de Ureña, in honor of their wedding. But we
have only Blas de Nasarre’s <i>dictum</i> for this, and he is not a good
authority: besides which, he adds that the author of the <i>comedia</i> in
question was John de la Enzina, who, we know, was not born earlier
than the year before the event referred to. The moment of the somewhat
secret marriage of these illustrious persons was, moreover, so full of
anxiety, that it is not at all likely <i>any</i> show or mumming accompanied
it. See Prescott’s Ferdinand and Isabella, Part I. c. 3.</p>

treats Mingo Revulgo as a satire against King John and his court. But
it applies much more naturally and truly to the time of Henry IV., and
has, indeed, generally been considered as directed against that unhappy
monarch. Copla the sixth seems plainly to allude to his passion for
Doña Guiomar de Castro.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_417"><span class="label"><a

very early attributed to John de Mena, the most famous poet of the
time (N. Antonio, Bib. Nov., Tom. I. p. 387); but, unhappily for this
conjecture, Mena was of the opposite party in politics. Mariana, who
found Revulgo of consequence enough to be mentioned when discussing the
troubles of Henry IV., declares (Historia, Lib. XXIII. c. 17, Tom. II.
p. 475) the Coplas to have been written by Hernando del Pulgar, the
chronicler; but no reason is given for this opinion except the fact
that Pulgar wrote a commentary on them, making their allegory more
intelligible than it would have been likely to be made by any body not
quite familiar with the thoughts and purposes of the author. See the
dedication of this commentary to Count Haro, with the Prólogo, and
Sarmiento, Poesía Española, Madrid, 1775, 4to, § 872. But whoever wrote
Mingo Revulgo, there is no doubt it was an important and a popular poem
in its day.</p>

un Viejo” was first printed, I believe, in the “Cancionero General”
of 1511, but it is found with the Coplas de Manrique, 1588 and 1632.
See, also, N. Antonio, Bib. Nov., Tom. II. pp. 263, 264, for notices
of Cota. The fact of this old Dialogue having an effect on the coming
drama may be inferred, not only from the obvious resemblance between
the two, but from a passage in Juan de la Enzina’s Eclogue beginning
“Vamonos, Gil, al aldea,” which plainly alludes to the opening of
Cota’s Dialogue, and, indeed, to the whole of it. The passage in Enzina
is the concluding <i>Villancico</i>, which begins,—</p>

<p id="Footnote_419"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_419">[419]</a></span> They are called <i>actos</i> in the
original; but neither <i>act</i> nor <i>scene</i> is a proper name for the parts
of which the Celestina is composed; since it occasionally mingles up,
in the most confused manner, and in the <i>same</i> act, conversations
that necessarily happened at the <i>same</i> moment in <i>different</i> places.
Thus, in the fourteenth act, we have conversations held partly between
Calisto and Melibœa inside her father’s garden, and partly between
Calisto’s servants, who are outside of it; all given as a consecutive
dialogue, without any notice of the change of place.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_420"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_420">[420]</a></span> Rojas, the author of all but the
first act of the Celestina, says, in a prefatory letter to a friend,
that the first act was supposed by some to have been the work of Juan
de Mena, and by others to have been the work of Rodrigo Cota. The
absurdity of the first conjecture was noticed long ago by Nicolas
Antonio, and has been admitted ever since, while, on the other hand,
what we have of Cota falls in quite well with the conjecture that <i>he</i>
wrote it; besides which, Alonso de Villegas, in the verses prefixed to
his “Selvagia,” 1554, to be noticed hereafter, says expressly, “Though
he was poor and of low estate, (<i>pobre y de baxo lugar</i>,) we know that
Cota’s skill (<i>ciencia</i>) enabled him to begin the great Celestina, and
that Rojas finished it with an ambrosial air that can never be enough
valued”;—a testimony heretofore overlooked, but one which, under the
circumstances of the case, seems sufficient to decide the question.</p>

<p class="ti1">As to the time when the Celestina was written, we must
bring it into the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, before which we
cannot find sufficient ground for believing such Spanish prose to have
been possible. It is curious, however, that, from one and the same
passage in the third act of the Celestina, Blanco White (Variedades,
London, 1824, 8vo, Tom. I. p. 226) supposes Rojas to have written
his part of it before the fall of Granada, and Germond de Lavigne
(Celestine, p. 63) supposes him to have written it either afterwards,
or at the very time when the last siege was going on. But Blanco
White’s inference seems to be the true one, and would place both parts
of it before 1490. If to this we add the allusions (Acts 4 and 7) to
the <i>autos da fé</i> and their arrangements, we must place it after 1480,
when the Inquisition was first established. But this is doubtful.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_421"><span class="label"><a

reasons for supposing that Seville is the city referred to. He himself
was born there, and could judge well.</p>

<p id="Footnote_422"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_422">[422]</a></span> The Trota-conventos of Juan
Ruiz, the Archpriest of Hita, has already been noticed; and certainly
is not without a resemblance to the Celestina. Besides, in the Second
Act of “Calisto y Melibœa,” Celestina herself is once expressly called
Trota-conventos.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_423"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_423">[423]</a></span> Rojas states these facts in
his prefatory anonymous letter, already mentioned, and entitled “El
Autor á un su Amigo”; and he declares his own name and authorship in
an acrostic, called “El Autor excusando su Obra,” which immediately
follows the epistle, and the initial letters of which bring out the
following words: “El Bachiller Fernando de Rojas acabó la comedia
de Calysto y Meliboea, y fue nascido en la puebla de Montalvan.” Of
course, if we believe Rojas himself, there can be no doubt on this
point.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_424"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_424">[424]</a></span> Blanco White, in a criticism
on the Celestina, (Variedades, Tom. I. pp. 224, 296,) expresses this
opinion, which is also found in the Preface to M. Germond de Lavigne’s
French translation of the Celestina. L. F. Moratin, too, (Obras, Tom.
I. Parte I. p. 88,) thinks there is no difference in style between the
two parts, though he treats them as the work of different writers. But
the acute author of the “Diálogo de las Lenguas” (Mayans y Siscar,
Orígenes, Madrid, 1737, 12mo, Tom. II. p. 165) is of a different
opinion, and so is Lampillas, Ensayo, Madrid, 1789, 4to, Tom. VI. p.
54.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_425"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_425">[425]</a></span> For a notice of the first known
edition,—that of 1499,—which is entitled “Comedia,” and is divided
into sixteen acts, see an article on the Celestina by F. Wolf, in
Blätter für Literarische Unterhaltung, 1845, Nos. 213 to 217, which
leaves little to desire on the subject it so thoroughly discusses. The
expurgations in the editions of Alcalá, 1586, and Madrid, 1595, are
slight, and in the Plantiniana edition, 1595, I think there are none.
It is curious to observe how few are ordered in the Index of 1667, (p.
948,) and that the <i>whole</i> book was not forbidden till 1793, having
been expressly permitted, with expurgations, in the Index of 1790,
and appearing first, as prohibited, in the Index of 1805. No other
book, that I know of, shows so distinctly how supple and compliant the
Inquisition was, where, as in this case, it was deemed impossible to
control the public taste. An Italian translation printed at Venice,
in 1525, which is well made, and is dedicated to a lady, is not
expurgated at all. There are lists of the editions of the original in
L. F. Moratin, (Obras, Tom. I. Parte I. p. 89,) and B. C. Aribau’s
“Biblioteca de Autores Españoles,” (Madrid, 1846, 8vo, Tom. III. p.
xii.,) to which, however, additions can be made by turning to Brunet,
Ebert, and the other bibliographers. The best editions are those of
Amarita (1822) and Aribau (1846).</p>

will be noticed hereafter, among the prose fictions of the seventeenth
century. The “Eufrosina” is by Ferreira de Vasconcellos, a Portuguese,
and why, in 1631, it was translated into Spanish by Ballesteros
Saavedra as if it had been anonymous, I know not. It is often mentioned
as the work of Lobo, another Portuguese, (Barbosa, Bib. Lusit., Tom.
II. p. 242, and Tom. IV. p. 143,) and Quevedo, in his Preface to the
Spanish version, seems to have been of that opinion; but this, too, is
not true. Lobo only prepared, in 1613, an edition of the Portuguese
original.</p>

<p class="ti1">Of the imitations of the Celestina mentioned in the
text, two, perhaps, deserve further notice.</p>

<p class="ti1">The first is the one entitled “Florinea,” which was
printed at Medina del Campo, in 1554, and which, though certainly
without the power and life of the work it imitates, is yet written in
a pure and good style. The principal personage is Marcelia,—parcel
witch, wholly shameless,—going regularly to matins and vespers, and
talking religion and philosophy, while her house and life are full of
whatever is most infamous. Some of the scenes are as indecent as any in
the Celestina; but the story is less disagreeable, as it ends with an
honorable love-match between Floriano and Belisea, the hero and heroine
of the drama, and promises to give their wedding in a continuation,
which, however, never appeared. It is longer than its prototype,
filling 312 pages of black letter, closely printed, in small quarto;
abounds in proverbs; and contains occasional snatches of poetry, which
are not in so good taste as the prose. Florian, the author, says,
that, though his work is called <i>comedia</i>, he is to be regarded as
“historiador cómico,” a dramatic narrator.</p>

<p class="ti1">The other is the “Selvagia,” by Alonso de Villegas,
published at Toledo, in 1554, 4to, the same year with the Florinea,
to which it alludes with great admiration. Its story is ingenious.
Flesinardo, a rich gentleman from Mexico, falls in love with Rosiana,
whom he has only seen at a window of her father’s house. His friend
Selvago, who is advised of this circumstance, watches the same window,
and falls in love with a lady whom he supposes to be the same that had
been seen by Flesinardo. Much trouble naturally follows. But it is
happily discovered that the lady is <i>not</i> the same; after which—except
in the episodes of the servants, the bully, and the inferior
lovers—every thing goes on successfully, under the management of an
unprincipled counterpart of the profligate Celestina, and ends with
the marriage of the four lovers. It is not so long as the Celestina or
the Florinea, filling only seventy-three leaves in quarto, but it is
an avowed imitation of both. Of the genius that gives such life and
movement to its principal prototype there is little trace, nor has it
an equal purity of style. But some of its declamations, perhaps,—though
as misplaced as its pedantry,—are not without power, and some of its
dialogue is free and natural. It claims everywhere to be very religious
and moral, but it is any thing rather than either. Of its author there
can be no doubt. As in every thing else he imitates the Celestina, so
he imitates it in prefatory acrostic verses, from which I have spelt
out the following sentence: “Alonso de Villegas Selvago compuso la
Comedia Selvagia en servicio de su Sennora Isabel de Barrionuevo,
siendo de edad de veynte annos, en Toledo, su patria”;—a singular
offering, certainly, to a lady-love. It is divided into scenes, as well
as acts.</p>

itself is to be found in Ochoa’s edition of the “Orígenes del Teatro

for instance, that of Inocencio, which reminds me occasionally of the
inimitable Dominie Sampson. An edition of it appeared at Milan in
1602, probably preceded—as in almost all cases seems of Spanish books
printed abroad—by an edition at home, and certainly followed by one at
Barcelona in 1613.</p>

called beautiful. Three translations of it, in the sixteenth century,

(Madrid, 1786, 12mo) filling a hundred pages, to which is added a
summary of the whole in a ballad of eighteen pages, which may have been
intended for popular recitation. The last is not, perhaps, the work of
Enzina. A similar pilgrimage, partly devout, partly poetical, was made
a century later by Pedro de Escobar Cabeza de la Vaca, who published an
account of it in 1587, (12mo,) at Valladolid, in twenty-five cantos of
blank verse, entitled “Lucero de la Tierra Santa,”—A Lighthouse for the
Holy Land. He went and returned by the way of Egypt, and at Jerusalem
became a knight-templar; but his account of what he saw and did, though
I doubt not it is curious for the history of geography, is as free
from the spirit of poetry as can well be imagined. Nearly the whole
of it, if not broken into verses, might be read as pure and dignified
Castilian prose, and parts of it would have considerable merit as
such.</p>

in the “Allgemeine Encyclopedie der Wissenschaften und Künste” (Erste

solemn acts, however different in their nature and character, like the

published, at Rome, a drama entitled “Placida y Victoriano,” which he
called <i>una egloga</i>, and which is much praised by the author of the
“Diálogo de las Lenguas”; but it was put into the Index Expurgatorius,

in his Tesoro, “is used in Salamanca, and means Carnival. In the
villages, they call it <i>Antruydo</i>; it is certain days before Lent....
They savor a little of heathenism.” Later, <i>Antruejo</i> became, from
a provincialism, an admitted word. Villalobos, about 1520, in his
amusing “Dialogue between the Duke and the Doctor,” says, “Y el dia
de Antruejo,” etc. (Obras, Çaragoça, 1544, folio, f. 35); and the
Academy’s dictionary has it, and defines it to be “the three last days
of Carnival.”</p>

“Carnal fuera! Carnal fuera!”—“Away, Carnival! away, Carnival!”—and
recalls the old ballad, “Afuera, afuera, Rodrigo!” It is found at f. 85
of the edition of 1509, and is preceded by another “Antruejo” eclogue,
represented the same day before the Duke and Duchess, beginning “O
triste de mi cuytado,” (f. 83,) and ending with a <i>villancico</i> full of
hopes of a peace with France.</p>

as a low, vulgar language. Besides, if it was so regarded, why did

say nothing of a multitude of other proud Portuguese, write

published his father’s Works at Lisbon, in folio, in 1562, of which
a reprint in quarto appeared there in 1586, much disfigured by the
Inquisition. But these are among the rarest and most curious books in
modern literature, and I remember to have seen hardly five copies, one
of which was in the library at Göttingen, and another in the public
library at Lisbon, the first in folio, and the last in quarto. Indeed,
so rare had the Works of Vicente become, that Moratin, to whom it
was very important to see a copy of them, and who knew whatever was
to be found at Madrid and Paris, in both which places he lived long,
never saw one, as is plain from No. 49 of his “Catálogo de Piezas
Dramáticas.” We therefore owe much to two Portuguese gentlemen, J. V.
Barreto Feio and J. G. Monteiro, who published an excellent edition of
Vicente’s Works at Hamburg, 1834, in three volumes, 8vo, using chiefly
the Göttingen copy. In this edition (Vol. I. p. 1) occurs the monologue
spoken of in the text, placed first, as the son says, “por ser á
<i>primeira</i> coisa, que o autor fez, <i>e que em Portugal se representou</i>.”
He says, the representation took place on the second night after the
birth of the prince, and, this being so exactly stated, we know that
the first secular dramatic exhibition in Portugal took place June 8,
1502, John III. having been born on the 6th. Crónica de D. Manoel,

is distinctly acknowledged by one of his contemporaries, Garcia de

the “Barca do Inferno,” was represented, in 1517, before the queen,
Maria of Castile, in her sick-chamber, when she was suffering under
the dreadful disease of which she soon afterwards died. Like the
“Barca do Purgatorio,” (1518,) it is in Portuguese, but the remaining
<i>Auto</i>, the “Barca da Gloria,” (1519,) is in Spanish. The last two
were represented in the royal chapel. The moral play of Lope de Vega
which was suggested by them is the one called “The Voyage of the Soul,”
and is found in the First Book of his “Peregrino en su Patria.” The
opening of Vicente’s play resembles remarkably the setting forth of the
Demonio on his voyage in Lope, besides that the general idea of the two
fictions is almost the same. On the other side of the account, Vicente
shows himself frequently familiar with the old Spanish literature. For
instance, in one of his Portuguese <i>Farças</i>, called “Dos Físicos,”
(Tom. III. p. 323,) we have—</p>

<p>a ballad which, so far as I know, can be traced no farther back than
the ballad-book of 1555, or, at any rate, that of 1550, while here we
have a distinct allusion to it before 1536, giving a curious proof
how widely this old popular poetry was carried about by the memories
of the people before it was written down and printed, and how much it
was used for dramatic purposes from the earliest period of theatrical
compositions.</p>

f. 175. b, etc. He himself, no doubt, flourished about the year
1500-1510. But I should not, probably, have alluded to him here, if he
had not been noticed in connection with the early Spanish theatre, by
Martinez de la Rosa (Obras, Paris, 1827, 12mo, Tom. II. p. 336). Other
poems, written in dialogue, by Alfonso de Cartagena, and by Puerto
Carrero, occur in the Cancioneros Generales, but they can hardly be
regarded as dramatic; and Clemencin twice notices Pedro de Lerma as one
of the early contributors to the Spanish drama; but he is not mentioned

<p id="Footnote_480"><span class="label"><a

Naharro’s verse. The “Hymenea,” for instance, is written in twelve-line
stanzas; the eleventh being a <i>pie quebrado</i>, or broken line. The
“Jacinta” is in twelve-line stanzas, without the <i>pie quebrado</i>. The
“Calamita” is in <i>quintillas</i>, connected by the <i>pie quebrado</i>. The
“Aquilana” is in <i>quartetas</i>, connected in the same way; and so on. But
the number of feet in each of his lines is not always exact, nor are
the rhymes always good, though, on the whole, a harmonious result is
generally produced.</p>

<p id="Footnote_481"><span class="label"><a

his Preface to the Reader, by saying that Italian words are introduced
into the <i>comedias</i> because of the audiences in Italy. This will do, as
far as the Italian is concerned; but what is to be said for the other
languages that are used? In the <i>Introyto</i> to the “Serafina,” he makes
a jest of the whole, telling the audience,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But you must all keep wide awake,</p>
<p class="i0">Or else in vain you’ll undertake</p>
<p class="i0">To comprehend the differing speech,</p>

<p class="i0">Four languages, as you will hear,</p>

a very severe passage on the Pope and the clergy at Rome, in the

many others, how capriciously and carelessly the Inquisition acted in
such matters. In the Index of 1667, (p. 114,) only the “Aquilana” is

Naharro’s plays were acted in Italy or not, has been angrily discussed
between Lampillas (Ensayo, Madrid, 1789, 4to, Tom. VI. pp. 160-167)
and Signorelli (Storia dei Teatri, Napoli, 1813, 8vo, Tom. VI. pp.
171, etc.), in consequence of a rash passage in Nasarre’s Prólogo to
the Plays of Cervantes, (Madrid, 1749, 4to,) I will copy the original
phrase of Naharro himself, which had escaped all the combatants, and
in which he says he used Italian words in his plays, “aviendo respeto
<i>al lugar</i>, y á las personas, á quien <i>se recitaron</i>.” Neither of these
learned persons knew even that the first edition of the “Propaladia”
was probably printed in Italy, and that one early edition was certainly
printed there.</p>

mean is shown by the words that follow: “<i>festejando con ellas á D.

in the halls and chapels of these great houses were accounted <i>public</i>

all this, and claimed that the Provençal literature was derived from
Catalonia. See Torres Amat, Prólogo to “Memorias de los Escritores
Catalanes,” and elsewhere. But it is only necessary to read what its
friends have said in defence of this position, to be satisfied that
it is untenable. The simple fact, that the literature in question
existed a full century in Provence before there is any pretence to
claim its existence in Catalonia, is decisive of the controversy, if
there really be a controversy about the matter. The “Memorias para
ayudar á formar un Diccionario Crítico de los Autores Catalanes,”
etc., by D. Felix Torres Amat, Bishop of Astorga, etc., (Barcelona,
1836, 8vo,) is, however, an indispensable book for the history of the
literature of Catalonia; for its author, descended from one of the old
and distinguished families of the country, and nephew of the learned
Archbishop Amat, who died in 1824, has devoted much of his life and of
his ample means to collect materials for it. It contains more mistakes
than it should; but a great deal of its information can be obtained

Raynouard, (Tom. II. pp. 174-178,) and Diez, “Troubadours,” (p. 111 and

feet high,—and by the mark of an arrow-wound in his forehead which
he received at Valencia, and which was still perfectly distinct. An

written a little before 1260; but that period was twenty-one years
after the date of <i>all</i> the facts recorded in Jayme’s account of the
conquest of Valencia. In connection with the question of the precedence
of these two Chronicles may be taken the circumstance, that it has
been believed by some persons that Jayme attempted to make Catalan the
language of the law and of all public records, thirty years before the
similar attempt already noticed was made by Alfonso X. in relation to
the Castilian. Villanueva, Viage Literario á las Iglesias de España,

Primer, Rey Daragò, de Mallorques, e de Valencia, Compte de Barcelona,
e de Munpesller, e de molts de sos Descendents, feta per lo magnifich
En Ramon Muntaner, lo qual servi axi al dit inclyt Rey Don Jaume com
á sos Fills e Descendents, es troba present á las Coses contengudes
en la present Historia.” There are two old editions of it; the first,
Valencia, 1558, and the second, Barcelona, 1562; both in folio, and the
last consisting of 248 leaves. It was evidently much used and trusted
by Zurita. (See his Anales, Lib. VII. c. 1, etc.) A neat edition of
it in large 8vo, edited by Karl Lanz, was published in 1844, by the
Stuttgard Verein, and a translation of it into German, by the same
accomplished scholar, appeared at Leipzig in 1842, in 2 vols. 8vo.</p>

the said city of Peralada, where I was born, and tarried in the house

of the Chronicle, and consists of twelve stanzas, each of twenty
lines, and each having all its twenty lines in one rhyme, the first
rhyme being in <i>o</i>, the second in <i>ent</i>, the third in <i>ayle</i>, and so
on. It sets forth the counsel of Muntaner to the king and prince on
the subject of the conquest they had projected; counsel which the
chronicler says was partly followed, and so the expedition turned out
well, but that it would have turned out better, if the advice had been
followed entirely. How good Muntaner’s counsel was we cannot now judge,
but his poetry is certainly naught. It is in the most artificial style
used by the Troubadours, and is well called by its author a <i>sermo</i>. He
says, however, that it was actually given to the king.</p>

back both the Catalonian and Valencian dialects to A. D. 728; but
the authority of Luitprand, on which he relies, is not sufficient,
especially as Luitprand shows that he believed these dialects to have
existed also in the time of Strabo. The most that should be inferred
from the passage Raynouard cites is, that they existed about 950, when
Luitprand wrote, which it is not improbable they did, though only in
their rudest elements, among the Christians in that part of Spain. Some
good remarks on the connection of the South of France with the South
of Spain, and their common idiom, may be found in Capmany, Memorias

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_541"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_541">[541]</a></span> The discussion makes out two
points quite clearly, viz.: 1st. There was a person named Jordi,
who lived in the thirteenth century and in the time of Jayme the
Conqueror, was much with that monarch, and wrote, as an eyewitness,
an account of the storm from which the royal fleet suffered at sea,
near Majorca, in September, 1269 (Ximeno, Escritores de Valencia,
Tom. I. p. 1; and Fuster, Biblioteca Valentiana, Tom. I. p. 1); and,
2d. There was a person named Jordi, a poet in the fifteenth century;
because the Marquis of Santillana, in his well-known letter, written
between 1454 and 1458, speaks of such a person as having lived in <i>his</i>
time. (See the letter in Sanchez, Tom. I. pp. lvi. and lvii., and the
notes on it, pp. 81-85.) Now the question is, to which of these two
persons belong the poems bearing the name of Jordi in the various
Cancioneros; for example, in the “Cancionero General,” 1573, f. 301,
and in the MS. Cancionero in the King’s Library at Paris, which is of
the fifteenth century. (Torres Amat, pp. 328-333.) This question is
of some consequence, because a passage attributed to Jordi is so very
like one in the 103d sonnet of Petrarch, (Parte I.,) that one of them
must be taken quite unceremoniously from the other. The Spaniards, and
especially the Catalans, have generally claimed the lines referred
to as the work of the <i>elder</i> Jordi, and so would make Petrarch
the copyist;—a claim in which foreigners have sometimes concurred.
(Retrospective Review, Vol. IV. pp. 46, 47, and Foscolo’s Essay on
Petrarch, London, 1823, 8vo, p. 65.) But it seems to me difficult for
an impartial person to read the verses printed by Torres Amat with
the name of Jordi from the <i>Paris</i> MS. Cancionero, and not believe
that they belong to the same century with the other poems in the same
manuscript, and that thus the Jordi in question lived after 1400, and
is the copyist of Petrarch. Indeed, the very position of these verses
in such a manuscript seems to prove it, as well as their tone and
character.</p>

which is in the Royal Library at Paris, M. Tastu, in 1834, gave an
account to Torres Amat, who was then preparing his “Memorias para
un Diccionario de Autores Catalanes” (Barcelona, 1836, 8vo). It is
numbered 7699, and consists of 260 leaves. See the Memorias, pp. xviii.
and xli., and the many poetical passages from it scattered through
other parts of that work. It is much to be desired that the whole
should be published; but, in the mean time, the ample extracts from it
given by Torres Amat leave no doubt of its general character. Another,
and in some respects even more ample, account of it, with extracts, is
to be found in Ochoa’s “Catálogo de Manuscritos” (4to, Paris, 1844, pp.
286-374). From this last description of the manuscript we learn that it
contains works of thirty-one poets.</p>

have called, in the translation, “a highway knight, of ancient right,”
was one of the successors of the marauding knights of the Middle Ages,
who were not always without generosity or a sense of justice, and
whose character is well set forth in the accounts of Roque Guinart or
Rocha Guinarda, the personage referred to in the text, and found in
the Second Part of Don Quixote (Capp. 60 and 61). He and his followers
are all called by Cervantes <i>Bandoleros</i>, and are the “banished men”
of “Robin Hood” and “The Nut-Brown Maid.” They took their name of
<i>Bandoleros</i> from the shoulder-belts they wore. Calderon’s “Luis Perez,
el Gallego” is founded on the history of a Bandolero supposed to have
lived in the time of the Armada, 1588.</p>

with the following title: “La Armonía del Parnas mes numerosa en las
Poesías varias del Atlant del Cel Poétic, lo D<sup>r.</sup> Vicent
Garcia” (Barcelona, 1700, 4to, 201 pp.). There has been some question
about the proper date of this edition, and therefore I give it as it
is in my copy. (See Torres Amat, Memorias, pp. 271-274.) It consists
chiefly of lyrical poetry, sonnets, <i>décimas</i>, <i>redondillas</i>, ballads,
etc.; but at the end is a drama called “Santa Barbara,” in three short
<i>jornadas</i>, with forty or fifty personages, some allegorical and some
supernatural, and the whole as fantastic as any thing of the age that
produced it. Another edition of Garcia’s Works was printed at Barcelona
in 1840, and a notice of him occurs in the Semanario Pintoresco, 1843,
p. 84.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_565"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_565">[565]</a></span> The Valencian has always remained
a sweet dialect. Cervantes praises it for its “honeyed grace” more than
once. See the second act of the “Gran Sultana,” and the opening of the
twelfth chapter in the third book of “Persiles and Sigismunda.” Mayans
y Siscar loses no occasion of honoring it; but he was a native of
Valencia, and full of Valencian prejudices.</p>

<p class="ti1">The literary history of the kingdom of Valencia—both
that of the period when its native dialect prevailed, and that of
the more recent period during which the Castilian has enjoyed the
supremacy—has been illustrated with remarkable diligence and success.
The first person who devoted himself to it was Josef Rodriguez, a
learned ecclesiastic, who was born in its capital in 1630, and died
there in 1703, just at the moment when his “Biblioteca Valentina” was
about to be issued from the press, and when, in fact, all but a few
pages of it had been printed. But though it was so near to publication,
a long time elapsed before it finally appeared; for his friend, Ignacio
Savalls, to whom the duty of completing it was intrusted, and who at
once busied himself with his task, died, at last, in 1746, without
having quite accomplished it.</p>

<p class="ti1">Meanwhile, however, copies of the imperfect work had
got abroad, and one of them came into the hands of Vicente Ximeno,
a Valencian, as well as Rodriguez, and, like him, interested in the
literary history of his native kingdom. At first, Ximeno conceived the
project of completing the work of his predecessor; but soon determined
rather to use its materials in preparing on the same subject another
and a larger one of his own, whose notices should come down to his own
time. This he soon completed, and published it at Valencia, in 1747-49,
in two volumes, folio, with the title of “Escritores de Valencia,”—not,
however, so quickly that the Biblioteca of Rodriguez had not been
fairly launched into the world, in the same city, in 1747, a few months
before the first volume of Ximeno’s appeared.</p>

<p class="ti1">The dictionary of Ximeno, who died in 1764, brings down
the literary history of Valencia to 1748, from which date to 1829 it
is continued by the “Biblioteca Valenciana” of Justo Pastor Fuster,
(Valencia, 1827-30, 2 tom., folio,) a valuable work, containing a great
number of new articles for the earlier period embraced by the labors of
Rodriguez and Ximeno, and making additions to many which they had left
imperfect.</p>

<p class="ti1">In the five volumes, folio, of which the whole series
consists, there are 2841 articles. How many of those in Ximeno relate
to authors noticed by Rodriguez, and how many of those in Fuster
relate to authors noticed by either or both of his predecessors, I
have not examined; but the number is, I think, smaller than might
be anticipated; while, on the other hand, the new articles and the
additions to the old ones are more considerable and important. Perhaps,
taking the whole together, no portion of Europe equally large has
had its intellectual history more carefully investigated than the
kingdom of Valencia;—a circumstance the more remarkable, if we bear
in mind that Rodriguez, the first person who undertook the work,
was, as he says, the first who attempted such a labor in any modern
language, and that Fuster, the last of them, though evidently a man
of curious learning, was by occupation a bookbinder, and was led to
his investigations, in a considerable degree, by his interest in the
rare books that were, from time to time, intrusted to his mechanical
skill.</p>

this regret, and have never reconciled themselves heartily to the

monuments of the old dialects of Spain is a translation of the Bible
into Catalan, made by Bonifacio Ferrer, who died in 1477, and was the
brother of St. Vincent Ferrer. It was printed at Valencia, in 1478,
(folio,) but the Inquisition came so soon to suppress it, that it never
exercised much influence on the literature or language of the country;
nearly every copy of it having been destroyed. Extracts from it and
sufficient accounts of it may be found in Castro, Bib. Española, (Tom.
I. pp. 444-448,) and McCrie’s “Reformation in Spain” (Edinburgh, 1829,
8vo, pp. 191 and 414). Sismondi, at the end of his discussion of the
Provençal literature, in his “Littérature du Midi de l’Europe,” has
some remarks on its decay, which in their tone are not entirely unlike
those in the last pages of this chapter, and to which I would refer
both to illustrate and to justify my own.</p>

applied occasionally to spiritual and religious affections, but almost
always to the love connected with gallantry. There has been a great
deal of discussion about its etymology and primitive meanings in the
Lexicons of Wachter, Ménage, Adelung, etc.; but it is enough for our
purpose to know that the word itself is peculiarly appropriate to the
fanciful and more or less conceited school of poetry that everywhere
appeared under the influences of chivalry. It is the word that gave
birth to the French <i>mignon</i>, the English <i>minion</i>, etc.</p>

which the author says that among the books burned was the one called
“Raziel,” from the name of one of the angels who guarded the entrance
to Paradise, and taught the art of divination to a son of Adam, from
whose traditions the book in question was compiled. It may be worth
while to add, that this Barrientos was a Dominican, one of the order of
monks to whom, thirty years afterwards, Spain was chiefly indebted for
the Inquisition, which soon bettered his example by burning, not only
books, but men. He died in 1469, having filled, at different times,
some of the principal offices in the kingdom.</p>

specimen given of the translation from Virgil, though short, affords
some reason to doubt whether the Marquis was a good Latin scholar. It
is in prose, and the Preface sets forth that it was written at the
earnest request of John, King of Navarre, whose curiosity about Virgil
had been excited by the reverential notices of him in Dante’s “Divina
Commedia.” See, also, Memorias de la Academia de Historia, Tom. VI.
p. 455, note. In the King’s Library at Paris is a prose translation
of the <i>last</i> nine books of Virgil’s Æneid, made, in 1430, by a Juan

Mendoza.” (Ochoa, Catálogo de Manuscritos, Paris, 1844, 4to, p. 375.)

folio, double columns, and is illustrated by eleven curious woodcuts,
well done for the period and country. The mistakes made about it are
remarkable, and render the details I have given of some consequence.

in 1499, and mentioned in Mendez, Typog. Esp., (p. 289,) I have never
seen a copy, and, except the above-mentioned copy of the first edition
and an imperfect one in the Royal Library at Paris, I know of none of
any edition;—so rare is it become.</p>

of his verses is in Bellermann’s “Alte Liederbücher der Portuguiesen”
(Berlin, 1840, 4to, pp. 24-26); to which may well be added, Argote de
Molina, “Nobleza del Andaluzia,” (Sevilla, 1588, folio, Lib. II. c.
148, f. 272,) Castro, “Biblioteca Española,” (Tom. I. p. 312,) and
Cortina’s notes to Bouterwek (p. 195). But the proofs of his early and
wide-spread fame are to be sought in Sanchez, “Poesías Anteriores”
(Tom. I. p. 138); in the “Cancionero General,” 1535 (ff. 67, 91); in
Juan de Mena, Copla 105, with the notes on it in the edition of Mena’s
Works, 1566; in “Celestina,” Act II.; in several plays of Calderon,
such as “Para vencer Amor querer vencerlo,” and “Qual es mayor
Perfeccion”; in Góngora’s ballads; and in many passages of Lope de Vega
and Cervantes. There are notices of Macias also in Ochoa, “Manuscritos
Españoles,” Paris, 1844, 4to, p. 505. In Vol. XLVIII. of “Comedias
Escogidas,” (1704, 4to,) is an anonymous play on his adventures and
death, entitled “El Español mas Amante,” in which the unhappy Macias
is killed at the moment the Marquis of Villena arrives to release him
from prison;—and in our own times, Larra has made him the hero of his
“Doncel de Don Enrique el Doliente,” already referred to, and of a
tragedy that bears his name, “Macias,” neither of them true to the
facts of history.</p>

<p id="Footnote_636"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_636">[636]</a></span> There is another collection of
proverbs made by the Marquis of Santillana, that is to be found in
Mayans y Siscar, “Orígenes de la Lengua Castellana” (Tom. II. pp.
179, etc.). They are, however, neither rhymed nor glossed; but simply
arranged in alphabetical order, as they were gathered from the lips of
the common people, or, as the collector says, “from the old women in
their chimney-corners.” For an account of the printed editions of the
<i>rhymed</i> proverbs prepared for Prince Henry, see Mendez, Typog. Esp.,
p. 196, and Sanchez, Tom. I. p. xxxiv. The seventeenth proverb, or that
on Prudence, may be taken as a fair specimen of the whole, all being in
the same measure and manner. It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Si fueres gran eloquente</p>
<p class="i0">Bien será,</p>
<p class="i0">Pero mas te converrá</p>
<p class="i0">Ser prudente.</p>
<p class="i0">Que <i>el prudente es obediente</i></p>
<p class="i0">Todavia</p>
<p class="i0">A moral filosofía</p>
<p class="i0">Y sirviente.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A few of the hundred proverbs have a prose commentary by the Marquis
himself; but neither have these the good fortune to escape the learned
discussions of the Toledan Doctor. The whole collection is spoken of
slightingly by the wise author of the “Diálogo de las Lenguas.” Mayans
y Siscar, Orígenes, Tom. II. p. 13.</p>

<p class="ti1">The same Pero Diaz, who burdened the Proverbs of the
Marquis of Santillana with a commentary, prepared, at the request
of John II., a collection of proverbs from Seneca, which were first
printed in 1482, and afterwards went through several editions. (Mendez,
Typog., pp. 266 and 197.) I have one of Seville, 1500 (fol., 66
leaves). They are about one hundred and fifty in number, and the prose
gloss with which each is accompanied seems in better taste and more
becoming its position than it does in the case of the rhymed proverbs
of the Marquis.</p>

<p id="Footnote_639"><span class="label"><a

because he had not the accomplishment common to all learned men of his
time,—that of speaking Latin. This appears from the very quaint and
rare treatise of the “Vita Beata,” by Juan de Lucena, his contemporary
and friend, where (ed. 1483, fol., f. ii. b) the Marquis is made to
say, “Me veo defetuoso de letras Latinas,” and adds, that the Bishop of
Burgos and Juan de Mena would have carried on in Latin the discussion
recorded in that treatise, instead of carrying it on in Spanish, if he
had been able to join them in that learned language. That the Marquis
could <i>read</i> Latin, however, is probable from his works, which are full
of allusions to Latin authors, and sometimes contain imitations of
them.</p>

Romero, in his “Epicedio en la Muerte del Maestro Hernan Nuñez,”
(Salamanca, 1578, 12mo, pp. 485, etc.,) at the end of the “Refranes de
Hernan Nuñez.” Concerning the place of his birth there is no doubt. He
alludes to it himself (Trescientas, Copla 124) in a way that does him
honor.</p>

<p id="Footnote_651"><span class="label"><a

are to be found chiefly in the old Cancioneros Generales; but some
must be sought in the old editions of his own works. For example,
in the valuable folio one of 1534, in which the “Trescientas” and
the “Coronacion” form separate publications, with separate titles,
pagings, and colophons, each is followed by a few of the author’s short
poems.</p>

las Lenguas” (Mayans y Siscar, Orígenes, Tom. II. p. 148) complained
of the frequent obscurities in Juan de Mena’s poetry, three centuries
ago,—a fault made abundantly apparent in the elaborate explanations
of his dark passages by the two oldest and most learned of his
commentators.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_653"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_653">[653]</a></span> Juan de Mena has always stood
well with his countrymen, if he has not been absolutely popular. Verses
by him appeared, during his lifetime, in the Cancionero of Baena, and
immediately afterwards in the Chronicle of the Constable. Others are
in the collection of poems already noticed, printed at Saragossa in
1492, and in another collection of the same period, but without date.
They are in all the old Cancioneros Generales, and in a succession of
separate editions, from 1496 to our own times. And besides all this,
the learned Hernan Nuñez de Guzman printed a commentary on them in
1499, and the still more learned Francisco Sanchez de las Brozas,
commonly called El Brocense, printed another in 1582; one or the other
of which accompanies the poems for their elucidation in nearly every
edition since.</p>

the Cancionero General of 1573; but do not appear at all in the edition
of the Works of the poet in 1566, and were not commented upon by
Hernan Nuñez. It is, indeed, doubtful whether they were really written
by Juan de Mena. If they were, they must probably have been produced
after the king’s death, for they are far from being flattering to him.
On this account, I am disposed to think they are not genuine; for the
poet seems to have permitted his great eulogies of the king and of the
Constable to stand after the death of both of them.</p>

for <i>hijo</i>, in the “Trescientas,” Copla 37, and <i>trinquete</i> for
<i>foresail</i>, in Copla 165, may serve as specimens. Lope de Vega (Obras
Sueltas, Tom. IV. p. 474) complains of Juan de Mena’s Latinisms, which
are indeed very awkward and abundant, and cites the following line:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">El amor es ficto, vaniloco, pigro.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I do not remember it; but it is as bad as some of the worst verses
of the same sort for which Ronsard has been ridiculed. It should be
observed, however, that, in the earliest periods of the Castilian
language, there was a greater connection with the French than there
was in the time of Juan de Mena. Thus, in the “Poem of the Cid,” we
have <i>cuer</i> for <i>heart</i>, <i>tiesta</i> for <i>head</i>, etc.; in Berceo, we have
<i>asemblar</i>, <i>to meet</i>; <i>sopear</i>, <i>to sup</i>, etc. (See Don Quixote, ed.
Clemencin, 1835, Tom. IV. p. 56.) If, therefore, we find a few French
words in Juan de Mena that are no longer used, like <i>sage</i>, which he
makes a dissyllable guttural to rhyme with <i>viage</i> in Copla 167, we
may presume he found them already in the language, from which they
have since been dropped. But Juan de Mena was, in all respects, too
bold; and, as the learned Sarmiento says of him in a manuscript which
I possess, “Many of his words are not at all Castilian, and were never
used either before his time or after it.”</p>

manner, I prefer the following verses, which he wrote for Count Pero
Niño, to be given to the Lady Beatrice, of whom, as was noticed when
speaking of his Chronicle, the Count was enamoured:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="ti1">But as the editor of the Chronicle says, (Madrid,
1782, 4to, p. 223,) “They are verses that might be attributed to any
other gallant or any other lady, so that it seems as if Villasandino
prepared such couplets to be given to the first person that should ask
for them”;—words cited here, because they apply to a great deal of
the poetry of the time of John II., which deals often in the coldest
commonplaces, and some of which was used, no doubt, as this was.</p>

which is found in the Cancioneros Generales, is amatory, and is as
good as the poetry of those old collections generally is. Two of the
treatises of Alonso were printed;—the “Oracional,” or Book of Devotion,
mentioned in the text as written for Perez de Guzman, which appeared
at Murcia in 1487, and the “Doctrinal de Cavalleros,” which appeared
the same year at Burgos. (Diosdado, De Prima Typographiæ Hispan. Ætate,

first appeared in 1512, as part of a <i>rifacimento</i> in Spanish of
Giovanni Colonna’s “Mare Historiarum,” which may have been the work
of Perez de Guzman. They begin, in this edition, at Cap. 137, after
long accounts of Trojans, Greeks, Romans, Fathers of the Church, and
others, taken from Colonna. (Mem. de la Acad. de Historia, Tom. VI. pp.
452, 453, note.) The first edition of the Generaciones y Semblanzas
separated from this connection occurs at the end of the Chronicle of
John II., 1517. They are also found in the edition of that Chronicle
of 1779, and with the “Centon Epistolario,” in the edition of Llaguno
Amirola, Madrid, 1775, 4to, where they are preceded by a life of Fernan
Perez de Guzman, containing the little we know of him. The suggestion
made in the Preface to the Chronicle of John II., (1779, p. xi.,)
that the two very important chapters at the end of the Generaciones
y Semblanzas are not the work of Fernan Perez de Guzman is, I think,
sufficiently answered by the editor of the Chronicle of Alvaro de Luna,

II. are among the most beautiful in the poem:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Where is the King, Don Juan? where</p>
<p class="i0">Each royal prince and noble heir</p>
<p class="i2">Of Aragon?</p>
<p class="i0">Where are the courtly gallantries?</p>
<p class="i0">The deeds of love and high emprise,</p>
<p class="i2">In battle done?</p>
<p class="i0">Tourney and joust, that charmed the eye,</p>
<p class="i0">And scarf, and gorgeous panoply,</p>
<p class="i2">And nodding plume,—</p>
<p class="i0">What were they but a pageant scene?</p>
<p class="i0">What but the garlands, gay and green,</p>
<p class="i2">That deck the tomb?</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">Where are the high-born dames, and where</p>
<p class="i0">Their gay attire, and jewelled hair,</p>
<p class="i2">And odors sweet?</p>
<p class="i0">Where are the gentle knights, that came</p>
<p class="i0">To kneel, and breathe love’s ardent flame,</p>
<p class="i2">Low at their feet?</p>
<p class="i0">Where is the song of the Troubadour?</p>
<p class="i0">Where are the lute and gay tambour</p>
<p class="i2">They loved of yore?</p>
<p class="i0">Where is the mazy dance of old,</p>
<p class="i0">The flowing robes, inwrought with gold,</p>
<p class="i2">The dancers wore?</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti1">These two stanzas, as well as the one in the text, are
from Mr. H. W. Longfellow’s beautiful translation of the Coplas, first
printed, Boston, 1833, 12mo, and often since. They may be compared with
a passage in the verses on Edward IV. attributed to Skelton, and found
in the “Mirror for Magistrates,” (London, 1815, 4to, Tom. II. p. 246,)
in which that prince is made to say, as if speaking from his grave,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">“Where is now my conquest and victory?</p>
<p class="i0">Where is my riches and royall array?</p>
<p class="i0">Where be my coursers and my horses hye?</p>
<p class="i0">Where is my myrth, my solace, and my play?”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed, the tone of the two poems is not unlike, though, of course,
the old English laureate never heard of Manrique and never imagined any
thing half so good as the Coplas. The Coplas were often imitated;—among
the rest, as Lope de Vega tells us, (Obras Sueltas, Madrid, 1777, 4to,
Tom. XI. p. xxix.,) by Camoens; but I do not know the Redondillas of
Camoens to which he refers. Lope admired the Coplas very much. He says
they should be written in letters of gold.</p>

I possess ten or twelve copies of other editions, one of which was
printed at Boston, 1833, with Mr. Longfellow’s translation. My copies,
dated 1574, 1588, 1614, 1632, and 1799, all have Glosas in verse. That
of Aranda is in folio, 1552, black letter, and in prose.</p>

<p class="ti1">At the end of a translation of the “Inferno” of Dante,
made by Pero Fernandez de Villegas, Archdeacon of Burgos, published at
Burgos in 1515, folio, with an elaborate commentary, chiefly from that
of Landino,—a very rare book, and one of considerable merit,—is found,
in a few copies, a poem on the “Vanity of Life,” by the translator,
which, though not equal to the Coplas of Manrique, reminds me of them.
It is called “Aversion del Mundo y Conversion á Dios,” and is divided,
with too much formality, into twenty stanzas on the contempt of the
world, and twenty in honor of a religious life; but the verses, which
are in the old national manner, are very flowing, and their style is
that of the purest and richest Castilian. It opens thus:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Away, malignant, cruel world,</p>
<p class="i2">With sin and sorrow rife!</p>
<p class="i0">I seek the meeker, wiser way</p>
<p class="i2">That leads to heavenly life.</p>
<p class="i0">Your fatal poisons here we drink,</p>
<p class="i2">Lured by their savors sweet,</p>
<p class="i0">Though, lurking in our flowery path,</p>
<p class="i2">The serpent wounds our feet.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">Away with thy deceitful snares,</p>
<p class="i2">Which all too late I fly!—</p>

belong, follow two more poems, the first entitled “The Complaint of
Faith,” partly by Diego de Burgos and partly by Pero Fernandez de
Villegas, and the second, a free translation of the Tenth Satire of
Juvenal, by Gerónimo de Villegas, brother of Pero Fernandez,—each poem
in about seventy or eighty octave stanzas, of <i>arte mayor</i>, but neither
of them as good as the “Vanity of Life.” Gerónimo also translated the
Sixth Satire of Juvenal into <i>coplas de arte mayor</i>, and published it
at Valladolid in 1519, in 4to.</p>

noticing his death, says, “He died in his best years,”—“en lo mejor de

at least, Don Jorge is mentioned in the great Spanish historian
as a personage important in the affairs of his time; but on yet a
fourth,—that of the death of his father, Rodrigo,—the words of Mariana
are so beautiful and apt, that I transcribe them in the original.
“Su hijo D. Jorge Manrique, en unas trovas muy elegantes, en que hay
virtudes poeticas y ricas esmaltes de ingenio, y sentencias graves,
a manera de endecha, lloró la muerte de su padre.” Lib. XXIV. c. 14.
It is seldom History goes out of its bloody course to render such a
tribute to Poetry, and still more seldom that it does it so gracefully.

Apóstolos was printed entire in London, 1843, 4to, by Don Miguel del
Riego, Canon of Oviedo, and brother of the Spanish patriot and martyr
of the same name. In the volume containing the Triumfos, the Canon has
given large extracts from the “Retablo de la Vida de Christo,” omitting
Cantos VII., VIII., IX., and X. For notices of Juan de Padilla, see
Antonio, Bib. Nov., Tom. I. p. 751, and Tom. II. p. 332; Mendez, Typog.
Esp., p. 193; and Sarmiento, Memorias, Sect. 844-847. From the last, it
appears that he rose to important ecclesiastical authority under the
crown, as well as in his own order. The Doze Triumfos was first printed
in 1512, the Retablo in 1505. There is a contemporary Spanish book,
with a title something resembling that of the Retablo de la Vida de
Christo del Cartuxano;—I mean the “Vita Christi Cartuxano,” which is a
translation of the “Vita Christi” of Ludolphus of Saxony, a Carthusian
monk who died about 1370, made into Castilian by Ambrosio Montesino,
and first published at Seville, in 1502. It is, in fact, a Life of
Christ, compiled out of the Evangelists, with ample commentaries and
reflections from the Fathers of the Church,—the whole filling four
folio volumes,—and in the version of Montesino it appears in a grave,
pure Castilian prose. It was translated by him at the command, he says,
of Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p id="Footnote_692"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_692">[692]</a></span> My copy is of the first edition,
of Çamora, Centenera, 1483, folio, 23 leaves, double columns, black
letter. It begins with these singular words, instead of a title-page:
“Aqui comença un tratado en estillo breve, en sentencias no solo largo
mas hondo y prolixo, el qual ha nombre Vita Beata, hecho y compuesto
por el honrado y muy discreto Juan de Lucena,” etc. There are also
editions of 1499 and 1541, and, I believe, yet another of 1501.
(Antonio, Bib. Vetus, ed. Bayer, Tom. II. p. 250; and Mendez, Typog.,
p. 267.) The following short passage—with an allusion to the opening
of Juvenal’s Tenth Satire, in better taste than is common in similar
works of the same period—will well illustrate its style. It is from
the remarks of the Bishop, in reply both to the poet and to the man of
the world. “Resta, pues, Señor Marques y tu Juan de Mena, mi sentencia
primera verdadera, que ninguno en esta vida vive beato. Desde Cadiz
hasta Ganges si toda la tierra expiamos [espiamos?] a ningund mortal
contenta su suerte. El caballero entre las puntas se codicia mercader;
y el mercader cavallero entre las brumas del mar, si los vientos
australes enpreñian las velas. Al parir de las lombardas desea hallarse
el pastor en el poblado; en campo el cibdadano; fuera religion los de
dentro como peçes y dentro querrian estar los de fuera,” etc. (fol.
xviii. a.) The treatise contains many Latinisms and Latin words, after
the absurd example of Juan de Mena; but it also contains many good old
words that we are sorry have become obsolete.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_693"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_693">[693]</a></span> The oldest edition, which is
without date, seems, from its type and paper, to have come from
the press of Centenera at Çamora, in which case it was printed
about 1480-1483. It begins thus: “Comença el tratado llamado Vision
Deleytable, compuesto por Alfonso de la Torre, bachiller, endereçado al
muy noble Don Juan de Beamonte, Prior de San Juan en Navarra.” It is
not paged, but fills 71 leaves in folio, double columns, black letter.
The little known of the different manuscripts and printed editions of
the Vision is to be found in Antonio, Bib. Vetus, ed. Bayer, Tom. II.
pp. 328, 329, with the note; Mendez, Typog., pp. 100 and 380, with the
Appendix, p. 402; and Castro, Biblioteca Española, Tom. I. pp. 630-635.
The Vision was written for the instruction of the Prince of Viana, who
is spoken of near the end as if still alive; and since this well-known
prince, the son of John, king of Navarre and Aragon, was born in 1421
and died in 1461, we know the limits between which the Vision must have
been produced. Indeed, being addressed to Beamonte, the Prince’s tutor,
it was probably written about 1430-1440, during the Prince’s nonage.
One of the old manuscripts of it says, “It was held in great esteem,
and, as such, was carefully kept in the chamber of the said king of
Aragon.” There is a life of the author in Rezabal y Ugarte, “Biblioteca
de los Autores, que han sido individuos de los seis colegios mayores”
(Madrid, 1805, 4to, p. 359). The best passage in the Vision Deleytable
is at the end; the address of Truth to Reason. There is a poem of
Alfonso de la Torre in MS. 7826, in the National Library, Paris
(Ochoa, Manuscritos, Paris, 1844, 4to, p. 479); and the poems of the
Bachiller Francisco de la Torre in the Cancionero, 1573, (ff. 124-127,)
and elsewhere, so much talked about in connection with Quevedo, have
sometimes been thought to be his, though the names differ.</p>

bequeathed his library to the University of Salamanca. Besides the two
treatises mentioned in the text, this volume contains an account of the
wound received by Ferdinand the Catholic, from the hand of an assassin,
at Barcelona, December 7, 1492; two letters from the city and cathedral
of Toledo, praying that the name of the newly conquered Granada may
not be placed before that of Toledo in the royal title; and an attack
on the Prothonotary Juan de Lucena,—probably not the author lately
mentioned,—who had ventured to assail the Inquisition, then in the
freshness of its holy pretensions. The whole volume is full of bigotry,
and the spirit of a triumphant priesthood.</p>

I. p. 241. Dibdin’s Ames, London, 1810, 4to, Vol. III. p. 195; Vol.
IV. p. 339.) To Diego de San Pedro is also attributed the “Tratado de
Arnalte y Lucenda,” of which an edition, apparently not the first,
was printed at Burgos in 1522, and another in 1527. (Asso, De Libris
Hisp. Rarioribus, Cæsaraugustæ, 1794, 4to, p. 44.) From a phrase in
his “Contempt of Fortune,” (Cancionero General, 1573, f. 158,) where
he speaks of “aquellas cartas de Amores, escriptas de dos en dos,”
I suspect he wrote the “Proceso de Cartas de Amores, que entre dos
amantes pasaron,”—a series of extravagant love-letters, full of the
conceits of the times; in which last case, he may also be the author
of the “Quexa y Aviso contra Amor,” or the story of Luzindaro and
Medusina, alluded to in the last of these letters. But as I know no
edition of this story earlier than that of 1553, I prefer to consider
it in the next period.</p>

appeared separately, it often occurs in the same volume with the

its style more than the Question de Amor. (Mayans y Siscar, Orígenes,
Tom. II. p. 167.) Both are in the Index Expurgatorius, 1667, pp. 323,
864; the last with a seeming ignorance, that regards it as a Portuguese

Espagnole et Française” (Paris, 1843, 8vo, Tom. I. pp. 393-397); in
Ochoa, “Manuscritos” (Paris, 1844, 4to, pp. 281-286); and in Amador
de los Rios, “Estudios sobre los Judios” (Madrid, 1848, 8vo, pp.
408-419). The copy used by Castro was probably from the library of
Queen Isabella, (Mem. de la Acad. de Hist., Tom. VI. p. 458, note,)
and is now in the National Library, Paris. Its collector, Baena, is
sneered at in the Cancionero of Fernan Martinez de Burgos, (Memorias
de Alfonso VIII. por Mondexar, Madrid, 1783, 4to, App. cxxxix.,) as a
Jew who wrote vulgar verses.</p>

<p class="ti1">The poems in this Cancionero that are probably not by
the persons whose names they bear are short and trifling,—such as
might be furnished to men of distinction by humble versifiers, who
sought their protection or formed a part of their courts. Thus, a poem
already noticed, that bears the name of Count Pero Niño, was, as we are
expressly told in a note to it, written by Villasandino, in order that
the Count might present himself before the lady Blanche more gracefully
than such a rough old soldier would be likely to do, unless he were
helped to a little poetical gallantry.</p>

introduction of the art of printing.</p>

<p class="ti1">One of them, compiled in 1464, with additions of a later
date, by Fernan Martinez de Burgos, begins with poems by his father,
and goes on with others by Villasandino, who is greatly praised both as
a soldier and a writer; by Fernan Sanchez de Talavera, some of which
are dated 1408; by Pero Velez de Guevara, 1422; by Gomez Manrique; by
Santillana; by Fernan Perez de Guzman; and, in short, by the authors
then best known at court. Mem. de Alfonso VIII., Madrid, 1783, 4to,

href="#FNanchor_716">[716]</a></span> In the Library of the Academy
of History at Madrid (Misc. Hist., MS., Tom. III., No. 2) is a poem
by Diego Lopez de Haro, of about a thousand lines, in a manuscript
apparently of the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth
century, of which I have a copy. It is entitled “Aviso para Cuerdos,”—A
Word for the Wise,—and is arranged as a dialogue, with a few verses
spoken in the character of some distinguished personage, human or
superhuman, allegorical, historical, or from Scripture, and then an
answer to each, by the author himself. In this way above sixty persons
are introduced, among whom are Adam and Eve, with the Angel that drove
them from Paradise, Troy, Priam, Jerusalem, Christ, Julius Cæsar, and
so on down to King Bamba and Mahomet. The whole is in the old Spanish
verse, and has little poetical thought in it, as may be seen by the
following words of Saul and the answer by Don Diego, which I give as a
favorable specimen of the entire poem:—</p>

<p class="ti1">Oviedo, in his “Quinquagenas,” says that Diego Lopez de
Haro was “the mirror of gallantry among the youth of his time”; and
he is known to history for his services in the war of Granada, and as
Spanish ambassador at Rome. (See Clemencin, in Mem. de la Acad. de
Hist., Tom. VI. p. 404.) He figures in the “Inferno de Amor” of Sanchez
de Badajoz; and his poems are found in the Cancionero General, 1573,
ff. 82-90, and a few other places.</p>

in the Cancioneros Generales,—for example, in that of 1573, at ff.
148-152, 189, etc.,—there is a MS. in possession of the Royal Academy
at Madrid, (Codex No. 114,) which contains a large number of poems by
Alvarez Gato. Their author was a person of consequence in his time, and
served John II., Henry IV., and Ferdinand and Isabella, in affairs of
state. With John he was on terms of friendship. One day, when the king
missed him from his hunting-party and was told he was indisposed, he
replied, “Let us, then, go and see him; he is my friend,”—and returned
to make the kindly visit. Gato died after 1495. Gerónimo Quintana,
Historia de Madrid, Madrid, 1629, folio, f. 221.</p>

<p class="ti1">The poetry of Gato is sometimes connected with public
affairs; but, in general, like the rest of that which marks the period
when it was written, it is in a courtly and affected tone, and devoted
to love and gallantry. Some of it is more lively and natural than most
of its doubtful class. Thus, when his lady-love told him “he must
talk sense,” he replied, that he had lost the little he ever had from
the time when he first saw her, ending his poetical answer with these
words:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

the <i>Glosas</i> to be “a most ancient and peculiarly Spanish composition,
never used in any other nation,” they were, in fact, an invention of
the Provençal poets, and, no doubt, came to Spain with their original
authors. (Raynouard, Troub., Tom. II. pp. 248-254.) The rules for their
composition in Spain were, as we see also from Cervantes, (Don Quixote,
Parte II. c. 18,) very strict and rarely observed; and I cannot help
agreeing with the friend of the mad knight, that the poetical results
obtained were little worth the trouble they cost. The <i>Glosas</i> of the

in this part of the Cancionero is as follows:—Costana, Puerto Carrero,
Avila, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Count Castro, Luis de Tovar, Don
Juan Manuel, Tapia, Nicolas Nuñez, Soria, Pinar, Ayllon, Badajoz el
Músico, the Count of Oliva, Cardona, Frances Carroz, Heredia, Artes,
Quiros, Coronel, Escriva, Vazquez, and Ludueña. Of most of them only
a few trifles are given. The “Burlas provocantes a Risa” follow, in
the edition of 1514, after the poems of Ludueña, but do not appear in
that of 1526, or in any subsequent edition. Most of them, however, are
found in the collection referred to, entitled “Cancionero de Obras de
Burlas provocantes a Risa” (Valencia, 1519, 4to). It begins with one
rather long poem, and ends with another,—the last being a brutal parody
of the “Trescientas” of Juan de Mena. The shorter poems are often by
well-known names, such as Jorge Manrique, and Diego de San Pedro, and
are not always liable to objection on the score of decency. But the
general tone of the work, which is attributed to ecclesiastical hands,
is as coarse as possible. A small edition of it was printed at London,
in 1841, marked on its title-page “Cum Privilegio, en Madrid, por Luis
Sanchez.” It has a curious and well-written Preface, and a short, but
learned, Glossary. From p. 203 to the end, p. 246, are a few poems not
found in the original Cancionero de Burlas; one by Garci Sanchez de
Badajoz, one by Rodrigo de Reynosa, etc.</p>

1535, which is of very little value, fills ff. 134-191. The whole
volume contains about 49,000 verses. The Antwerp editions of 1557 and
1573 are larger, and contain about 58,000; but the last part of each
is the worst part. One of the pieces near the end is a ballad on the
renunciation of empire made by Charles V. at Brussels, in October,
1555; the most recent date, so far as I have observed, that can be
assigned to any poem in any of the collections.</p>

Juan de Mena; and in the fine old Chronicle of the Constable’s life,
we are told of him, (Título LXVIII.,) “Fue muy inventivo e mucho dado
a fallar <i>invenciones</i> y sacar entremeses, o en justas o en guerra;
en las quales invenciones muy agudamente significaba lo que queria.”
He is also the author of an unpublished prose work, dated 1446, “On
Virtuous and Famous Women,” to which Juan de Mena wrote a Preface;
the Constable, at that time, being at the height of his power. It is
not, as its title might seem to indicate, translated from a work by
Boccaccio, with nearly the same name; but an original production of the
great Castilian minister of state. Mem. de la Acad. de Hist., Tom. VI.

<p id="Footnote_734"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_734">[734]</a></span> The bitterness of this
unchristian and barbarous hatred of the Moors, that constituted not
a little of the foundation on which rested the intolerance that
afterwards did so much to break down the intellectual independence
of the Spanish people, can hardly be credited at the present day,
when stated in general terms. An instance of its operation, must,
therefore, be given to illustrate its intensity. When the Spaniards
made one of those forays into the territories of the Moors that were
so common for centuries, the Christian knights, on their return, often
brought, dangling at their saddle-bows, the heads of the Moors they
had slain, and threw them to the boys in the streets of the villages,
to exasperate their young hatred against the enemies of their faith;—a
practice which, we are told on good authority, was continued as late as
the war of the Alpuxarras, under Don John of Austria, in the reign of
Philip II. (Clemencin, in Memorias de la Acad. de Hist., Tom. VI. p.
390.) But any body who will read the “Historia de la Rebelion y Castigo
de los Moriscos del Reyno de Granada,” by Luis del Marmol Carvajal,
(Málaga, 1600, fol.,) will see how complacently an eyewitness, not so
much disposed as most of his countrymen to look with hatred on the
Moors, regarded cruelties which it is not possible now to read without
shuddering. See his account of the murder, by order of the chivalrous
Don John of Austria, (f. 192,) of four hundred women and children, his
captives at Galera;—“muchos en su presencia,” says the historian, who
was there. Similar remarks might be made about the second volume of
Hita’s “Guerras de Granada,” which will be noticed hereafter. Indeed,
it is only by reading such books that it is possible to learn how
much the Spanish character was impaired and degraded by this hatred,
inculcated, during the nine centuries that elapsed between the age of
Roderic the Goth and that of Philip III., not only as a part of the
loyalty of which all Spaniards were so proud, but as a religious duty
of every Christian in the kingdom.</p>

Inquisition in Spain. In this attempt I think he fails; but I think he
is successful when he elsewhere maintains that the Inquisition, from an

in Spain, and always dependent on the state for a large part of its
power.</p>

the Inquisition as I have spoken in this chapter, without feeling
desirous to know something concerning Antonio Llorente, who has done
more than all other persons to expose its true history and character.
The important facts in his life are few. He was born at Calahorra in
Aragon in 1756, and entered the Church early, but devoted himself to
the study of canon law and of elegant literature. In 1789, he was made
principal secretary to the Inquisition, and became much interested
in its affairs; but was dismissed from his place and exiled to his
parish in 1791, because he was suspected of an inclination towards the
French philosophy of the period. In 1793, a more enlightened General
Inquisitor than the one who had persecuted him drew Llorente again
into the councils of the Holy Office, and, with the assistance of
Jovellanos and other leading statesmen, he endeavoured to introduce
such changes into the tribunal itself as should obtain publicity for
its proceedings. But this, too, failed, and Llorente was disgraced
anew. In 1805, however, he was recalled to Madrid; and in 1809, when
the fortunes of Joseph Bonaparte made him the nominal king of Spain,
he gave Llorente charge of every thing relating to the archives and
the affairs of the Inquisition. Llorente used well the means thus put
into his hands; and having been compelled to follow the government of
Joseph to Paris, after its overthrow in Spain, he published there,
from the vast and rich materials he had collected during the period
when he had entire control of the secret records of the Inquisition,
an ample history of its conduct and crimes;—a work which, though
neither well arranged nor philosophically written, is yet the great
store-house from which are to be drawn more well-authenticated facts
relating to the subject it discusses than can be found in all other
sources put together. But neither in Paris, where he lived in poverty,
was Llorente suffered to live in peace. In 1823, he was required by
the French government to leave France, and being obliged to make his
journey during a rigorous season, when he was already much broken by
age and its infirmities, he died from fatigue and exhaustion, on the
3d of February, a few days after his arrival at Madrid. His “Histoire
de l’Inquisition” (4 tom., 8vo, Paris, 1817-1818) is his great work;
but we should add to it his “Noticia Biográfica,” (Paris, 1818, 12mo,)
which is curious and interesting, not only as an autobiography, but for
further notices respecting the spirit of the Inquisition.</p>

<p id="Footnote_743"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_743">[743]</a></span> The Grand Inquisitors had always
shown an instinctive desire to obtain jurisdiction over books, whether
printed or manuscript. Torquemada, the fiercest, if not quite the first
of them, burned at Seville, in 1490, a quantity of Hebrew Bibles and
other manuscripts, on the ground that they were the work of Jews; and
at Salamanca, subsequently, he destroyed, in the same way, six thousand
volumes more, on the ground that they were books of magic and sorcery.
But in all this he proceeded, not by virtue of his Inquisitorial
office, but, as Barrientos had done forty years before, (see <i>ante</i>,
p. 359,) by direct royal authority. Until 1521, therefore, the press
remained in the hands of the <i>Oidores</i>, or judges of the higher
courts, and other persons civil and ecclesiastical, who, from the
first appearance of printing in the country, and certainly for above
twenty years after that period, had granted, by special power from the
sovereigns, whatever licenses were deemed necessary for the printing
and circulation of books. Llorente, Hist. de l’Inquisition, Tom. I. pp.

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_744"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_744">[744]</a></span> I notice in a few works printed
before 1550, that the Inquisition, without formal authority, began
quietly to take cognizance and control of books that were about to
be published. Thus, in a curious treatise on Exchange, “Tratado de
Cambios,” by Cristóval de Villalon, printed at Valladolid in 1541,
4to, the title-page declares that it had been “visto por los Señores
Inquisidores”; and in Pero Mexia’s “Silva de Varia Leccion,” (Sevilla,
1543, folio,) though the title gives the imperial license for printing,
the colophon adds that of the Apostolical Inquisitor. There was no
reason for either, except the anxiety of the author to be safe from
an authority which rested on no law, but which was already recognized
as formidable. Similar remarks may be made about the “Theórica de
Virtudes” of Castilla, which was formally licensed, in 1536, by Alonso
Manrique, the Inquisitor-General, though it was dedicated to the
Emperor, and bears the Imperial authority to print.</p>

it was worse. From 1550, a certificate was obliged to accompany <i>every</i>
book, setting forth, that it was <i>not</i> a prohibited book, without which
certificate, <i>no</i> book was permitted to be <i>sold</i> or <i>read</i> in the
colonies. (Llorente, Tom. I. p. 467.) But thus far the Inquisition, in
relation to the Index Expurgatorius, consulted the civil authorities,
or was specially authorized by them to act. In 1640 this ceremony
was no longer observed, and the Index was printed by the Inquisition
alone, without any commission from the civil government. From the time
when the danger of the heresy of Luther became considerable, no books
arriving from Germany and France were permitted to be circulated in
Spain, except by special license. Bisbe y Vidal, Tratado de Comedias,

to the position these extraordinary offices gave him, and exercised
his great authority with sagacity and zeal, and with a confidence
in the resources of his own genius that seemed to double his power.
It should, however, never be forgotten, that, <i>but for him</i>, the
Inquisition, instead of being enlarged, as it was, twenty years after
its establishment, would have been constrained within comparatively
narrow limits, and probably soon overthrown. For, in 1512, when the
embarrassments of the public treasury inclined Ferdinand to accept
from the persecuted new converts a large sum of money, which he needed
to carry on his war against Navarre,—a gift which they offered on
the single and most righteous condition, that witnesses cited before
the Inquisition should be examined <i>publicly</i>,—Cardinal Ximenes not
only used his influence with the king to prevent him from accepting
the offer, but furnished him with resources that made its acceptance
unnecessary. And again, in 1517, when Charles V., young and not without
generous impulses, received, on the same just condition, from the same
oppressed Christians, a still larger offer of money to defray his
expenses in taking possession of his kingdom, and when he had obtained
assurances of the reasonableness of granting their request from the
principal universities and men of learning in Spain and in Flanders,
Cardinal Ximenes interposed anew his great influence, and—not without
some suppression of the truth—prevented a second time the acceptance
of the offer. He, too, it was, who arranged the jurisdiction of the
tribunals of the Inquisition in the different provinces, settling them
on deeper and more solid foundations; and, finally, it was this master
spirit of his time who first carried the Inquisition beyond the limits
of Spain, establishing it in Oran, which was his personal conquest,
and in the Canaries, and Cuba, where he made provident arrangements,
by virtue of which it was subsequently extended through all Spanish
America. And yet, before he wielded the power of the Inquisition, he
opposed its establishment. Llorente, Hist., Chap. X., Art. 5 and 7.</p>

Bologna, like most of the other striking events in Spanish history, was
brought upon the Spanish theatre. It is circumstantially represented in
“Los dos Monarcas de Europa,” by Bartolomé de Salazar y Luna. (Comedias
Escogidas, Madrid, 1665, 4to, Tomo XXII.) But the play is quite too
extravagant in its claims, both as respects the Emperor’s humiliation
and the Pope’s glory, considering that Clement VII. had so lately been
the Emperor’s prisoner. As the ceremony is about to begin, a procession
of priests enters, chanting,—</p>

to publish his works granted to Boscan’s widow, by Charles V., Feb.
18, 1543, and prefixed to the very rare and important edition of his
works and those of his friend Garcilasso, published for the first time
in the same year, at Barcelona, by Amoros; a small 4to, containing 237
leaves. This edition is said to have been at once counterfeited, and
was certainly reprinted not less than six times as early as 1546, three
years after its first appearance. In 1553, Alonso de Ulloa, a Spaniard,
at Venice, who published many Spanish books there with prefaces of some
value by himself, printed it in 18mo, very neatly, and added a few
poems to those found in the first edition; particularly one, at the
beginning of the volume, entitled “Conversion de Boscan,” religious
in its subject, and national in its form. At the end Ulloa puts a
few pages of verse, attacking the Italian forms adopted by Boscan;
describing what he thus adds as by “an uncertain author.” They are,
however, the work of Castillejo, and are found in Obras de Castillejo,
Anvers, 1598, 18mo, f. 110, etc.</p>

<p id="Footnote_761"><span class="label"><a

Burlesque Ballads, has made himself merry (Obras, Madrid, 1654, 4to,
f. 104, etc.) at the expense of Boscan’s “Leandro.” But he has taken
the same freedom with better things.</p>

<p class="ti1">The Leandro was, I think, the first attempt to introduce
blank verse, which was thus brought by Boscan into the poetry of
Spain in 1543, as it was a little later into English, from the
<i>versi sciolti</i> of the Italians, by Surrey, who called it “a strange
meter.” Acuña soon followed in Castilian with other examples of it;
but the first really good Spanish blank verse known to me is to be
found in the eclogue of “Tirsi” by Francisco de Figueroa, written
about half a century after the time of Boscan, and not printed till
1626. The translation of a part of the Odyssey by Perez, in 1553, and
the “Sagrada Eratos” of Alonso Carillo Laso de la Vega, which is a
paraphrase of the Psalms, printed at Naples in 1657, folio, afford
much longer specimens that are generally respectable. But the full
rhyme is so easy in Spanish, and the <i>asonante</i> is so much easier, that
blank verse, though it has been used from the middle of the sixteenth
century, has been little cultivated or favored.</p>

Tom. I., Valladolid, 1604, 4to). But the tradition, I think, is not
true. Oviedo directly contradicts it, when giving an account of the
family of the poet’s father; and as he knew them, his authority is
perhaps decisive. (Quinquagenas, Batalla I. Quin. iii. Diálogo 43, MS.)
But, besides this, Lord Holland (Life of Lope, London, 1817, 8vo, Vol.
I. p. 2) gives good reasons against the authenticity of the story,
which Wiffen (Works of Garcilasso, London, 1823, 8vo, pp. 100 and 384)
answers as well as he can, but not effectually. It is really a pity it
cannot be made out to be true, it is so poetically appropriate.</p>

<p>I know of no earlier instance of this precise rhyme, which is quite
different from the lawless rhymes that sometimes broke the verses of
the Minnesingers and Troubadours. Cervantes used it, nearly a century
afterwards, in his “Cancion de Grisóstomo,” (Don Quixote, Parte I. c.
14,) and Pellicer, in his commentary on the passage, regards Cervantes
as the inventor of it. Perhaps Garcilasso’s rhymes had escaped
all notice; for they are not the subject of remark by his learned
commentators. In English, instances of this peculiarity may be found
occasionally amidst the riotous waste of rhymes in Southey’s “Curse
of Kehama,” and in Italian they occur in Alfieri’s “Saul,” Act III.
sc. 4. I do not remember to have seen them again in Spanish except in
some <i>décimas</i> of Pedro de Salas, printed in 1638, and in the second
<i>jornada</i> of the “Pretendiente al Reves” of Tirso de Molina, 1634. No
doubt they occur elsewhere, but they are rare, I think.</p>

Salamanca, 1574, 18mo; a modest work, which has been printed often
since. This was followed at Seville, in 1580, by the elaborate edition
of Herrera, in 8vo, filling nearly seven hundred pages, chiefly
with its commentary, which is so cumbersome, that it has never been
reprinted, though it contains a good deal important, both to the
history of Garcilasso, and to the elucidation of the earlier Spanish
literature. Tamayo de Vargas was not satisfied with either of them, and
published a commentary of his own at Madrid in 1622, 18mo, but it is of
little worth. Perhaps the most agreeable edition of Garcilasso is one
published, without its editor’s name, in 1765, by the Chevalier Joseph
Nicolas de Azara; long the ambassador of Spain at Rome, and at the head
of what was most distinguished in the intellectual society of that
capital. In English, Garcilasso was made known by J. H. Wiffen, who,
in 1823, published at London, in 8vo, a translation of all his works,
prefixing a Life and an Essay on Spanish Poetry; but the translation is
constrained, and fails in the harmony that so much distinguishes the
original, and the dissertation is heavy and not always accurate in its
statement of facts.</p>

<p id="Footnote_788"><span class="label"><a

Garcilasso by Cervantes are chiefly in the latter part of his life;
namely, in the second part of his Don Quixote, in his Comedias, his
Novelas, and his “Persiles y Sigismunda,” as if his admiration were the
result of his matured judgment. More than once he calls him “the prince
of Spanish poets”; but this title, which can be traced back to Herrera,
and has been continued down to our own times, has, perhaps, rarely been
taken literally.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_789"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_789">[789]</a></span> How decidedly Garcilasso rejected
the Spanish poetry written before his time can be seen, not only by
his own example, but by his letter prefixed to Boscan’s translation of
Castiglione, where he says that he holds it to be a great benefit to
the Spanish language to translate into it things really worthy to be
read; “for,” he adds, “I know not what ill luck has always followed us,
but hardly any body has written any thing in our tongue worthy of that
trouble.” It may be noted, on the other hand, that scarcely a word or
phrase used by Garcilasso has ceased to be accounted pure Castilian;—a
remark that can be extended, I think, to no writer so early. His
language lives as he does, and, in no small degree, <i>because</i> his
success has consecrated it. The word <i>desbañar</i>, in his second Eclogue,
is, perhaps, the only exception to this remark.</p>

<p id="Footnote_790"><span class="label"><a

publication of the works of Boscan and Garcilasso, Hernando de Hozes,
in the Preface to his “Triumfos de Petrarca,” (Medina del Campo, 1554,
4to,) says, with much truth: “Since Garcilasso de la Vega and Juan
Boscan introduced Tuscan measures into our Spanish language, every
thing earlier, written or translated, in the forms of verse then used
in Spain, has so much lost reputation, that few now care to read it,
though, as we all know, some of it is of great value.” If this opinion
had continued to prevail, Spanish literature would not have become what
it now is.</p>

well-known German poem “Theuerdank,” which was devoted to the
adventures of Maximilian I. up to the time when he married Mary of
Burgundy, and, like that, owes some of its reputation to the bold
engravings with which its successive editions were ornamented. One
of the best of the Cavallero Determinado is the Plantiniana, Anvers,
1591, 8vo. The account of the part—earlier unsuspected—borne by the
Emperor in the composition of the Cavallero Determinado is found on pp.
15 and 16 of the “Lettres sur la Vie Intérieure de l’Empereur Charles
Quint, par Guillaume Van Male, Gentilhomme de sa Chambre, publiées
pour la première fois par le Baron de Reiffenberg, Bruxelles, Société
des Bibliophiles Belgiques, à Bruxelles, 1843,” 4to; a very curious
collection of thirty-one Latin letters, that often contain strange
details of the infirmities of the Emperor from 1550 to 1555. Their
author, Van Male, or Malinæus as he was called in Latin, and Malinez
in Spanish, was one of the needy Flemings who sought favor at the
court of Charles V. Being ill treated by the Duke of Alva, who was
his first patron; by Avila y Zuñiga, whose Commentaries he translated
into Latin, in order to purchase his regard; and by the Emperor, to
whom he rendered many kind and faithful services, he was, like many
others who had come to Spain with similar hopes, glad to return to
Flanders as poor as he came. He died in 1560. He was an accomplished
and simple-hearted scholar, and deserved a better fate than to be
rewarded for his devotion to the Imperial humors by a present of
Acuña’s manuscript, which Avila had the malice to assure the Emperor
would be well worth five hundred gold crowns to the suffering man of
letters;—a remark to which the Emperor replied by saying, “William will
come rightfully by the money; he has sweat hard at the work,”—“Bono
jure fructus ille ad Gulielmum redeat; ut qui plurimum in illo opere
sudârit.” Of the Emperor’s personal share in the version of the
Chevalier Délibéré Van Male gives the following account (Jan. 13,
1551):—“Cæsar maturat editionem libri, cui titulus erat Gallicus,—Le
Chevalier Délibéré. Hunc per otium <i>a seipso traductum</i> tradidit
Ferdinando Acunæ, Saxonis custodi, ut ab eo aptaretur ad numeros rithmi
Hispanici; quæ res cecidit felicissimè. <i>Cæsari, sine dubio, debetur
primaria traductionis industria, cùm non solùm linguam, sed et carmen
et vocum significantiam mirè expressit</i>,” etc. Epist. vi. </p>

we know of him is in Sismondi, Lit. Esp., Sevilla, 1841, Tom. I. p.
381. Probably he died young. (Conde Lucanor, 1575, ff. 93, 94.) The
poems of Cetina were, in 1776, extant in a MS. in the library of the
Duke of Arcos, at Madrid. (Obras Sueltas de Lope de Vega, Madrid, 1776,

died about 1596, in which case he must have been very old; especially
if, as Moratin thinks, he was born in 1494! But the facts stated about
him are quite uncertain, with the exception of those told by himself.
(L. F. Moratin, Obras, Tom. I. Parte I. pp. 154-156.) His works were
well published at Antwerp, by Bellero, in 1598, 18mo, and in Madrid,
by Sanchez, in 1600, 18mo, and they form the twelfth and thirteenth
volumes of the Collection of Fernandez, Madrid, 1792, 12mo, besides
which I have seen editions cited of 1582, 1615, etc. His dramas are
lost;—even the “Costanza,” which Moratin saw in the Escurial, could not
be found there in 1844, when I caused a search to be made for it.</p>

edition, Medina del Campo, 1577, 12mo. Like other poets who deal in
prettinesses, Villegas repeats himself occasionally, because he so
much admires his own conceits. Thus, the idea in the little <i>décima</i>
translated in the text is also in a pastoral—half poetry, half prose—in
the same volume. “Assi como dos instrumentos bien templados tocando las
cuerdas del uno se tocan y suenan las del otro ellas mismas; assi yo en

renewed in the Index Expurgatorius, 1667. Indeed, I do not know how the
chapter on the seller of indulgences could have been written by any
but a Protestant, after the Reformation was so far advanced as it then
was. Mendoza does not seem ever to have acknowledged himself to be the
author of Lazarillo de Tórmes, which, in fact, was sometimes attributed
to Juan de Ortega, a monk. Of a translation of Lazarillo into English,

of “Cartas del Bachiller de Arcadia.” The <i>Catariberas</i>, whom Mendoza
so vehemently attacks in the first of them, seem to have sunk still
lower after his time, and become a sort of jackals to the lawyers. See
the “Soldado Pindaro” of Gonçalo de Cespedes y Meneses, (Lisboa, 1626,
4to, f. 37. b,) where they are treated with the cruellest satire. I
have seen it suggested that Diego de Mendoza is not the author of the
last of the two letters, but I do not know on what ground.</p>

occupations and character of Mendoza, during the last two years of
his life, may be found in several letters he wrote to Zurita, the
historian, which are preserved in Dormer, “Progresos de la Historia de
Aragon” (Zaragoza, 1680, folio, pp. 501, etc.). The way in which he
announces his intention of giving his books to the Escurial Library, in
a letter, dated at Granada, 1 Dec., 1573, is very characteristic: “I
keep collecting my books and sending them to Alcalá, because the late
Doctor Velasco wrote me word, that his Majesty would be pleased to see
them, and perhaps put them in the Escurial. And I think he is right;
for as it is the most sumptuous building of ancient or modern times,
that I have seen, so I think that nothing should be wanting in it, and
that it ought to contain the most sumptuous library in the world.” In
another, a few months only before his death, he says, “I go on dusting
my books and examining them to see whether they are injured by the
rats, and am well pleased to find them in good condition. Strange
authors there are among them, of whom I have no recollection; and I
wonder I have learnt so little, when I find how much I have read.”

<p id="Footnote_830"><span class="label"><a

the questions sent to him were in such bad verse, that it cost him
a great deal of labor to put them into a proper shape; and it must
be admitted, that both questions and answers generally read as if
they came from one hand. Sometimes a long moral dissertation occurs,
especially in the prose of the second volume, but the answers are
rarely tedious from their length. Those in the first volume are the
best, and Nos. 280, 281, 282, are curious, from the accounts they
contain of the poet himself, who must have died after 1552. In the
Preface to the first volume, he says the Admiral died in 1538. If the
whole work had been completed, according to its author’s purpose, it
would have contained just a thousand questions and answers. For a
specimen, we may take No. 10 (Quatrocientas Preguntas, Çaragoça, 1545,
folio) as one of the more ridiculous, where the Admiral asks how many
keys Christ gave to St. Peter, and No. 190 as one of the better sort,
where the Admiral asks, whether it be necessary to kneel before the
priest at confession, if the penitent finds it very painful; to which
the old monk answers gently and well,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">He that, through suffering sent from God above</p>
<p class="i2">Confessing, kneels not, still commits no sin;</p>
<p class="i0">But let him cherish modest, humble love,</p>
<p class="i2">And that shall purify his heart within.</p>

<p>The fifth part of the first volume consists of riddles in the old
style; and, as Escobar adds, they are sometimes truly very old riddles;
so old, that they must have been generally known. The second volume was
printed at Valladolid, 1552, and both are in folio.</p>

were become ashamed to write any longer in Latin, as if their own
language were unfit for practical use in matters of grave importance,
when they had, in the Italian, examples of entire success before them.

12mo. In the Index Expurgatorius, (1667, p. 424,) they are forbidden
to be read, “till they are corrected,”—a phrase which seems to have
left each copy of them to the discretion of the spiritual director of
its owner. In the edition of 1787, a sheet was cancelled, in order
to get rid of a note of Morales. See Index of 1790.</p>

Morales published fifteen moral discourses of his own, and one by Pedro
Valles of Córdova, none of which have much literary value, though

becoming a Royal Chronicler; the next four on the Differences between
a Rustic and a Noble Life; and the remaining thirty-one on Preparation
for Death;—all written in a pure, simple Castilian style, but with
little either new or striking in the thoughts. Their author says,
it was a rule of the <i>Academia</i>, that the person who arrived last
at each meeting should furnish a subject for discussion, and direct
another member to reduce to writing the remarks that might be made on
it,—Cardinal Poggio, Juan d’Estuñiga, knight-commander of Castile,
and other persons of note, being of the society. Navarra adds, that
he had written two hundred dialogues, in which there were “few
matters that had not been touched upon in that excellent Academy,”
and notes especially, that the subject of Preparation for Death had
been discussed after the decease of Cobos, a confidential minister
of Charles V., and that he himself had acted as secretary on the
occasion. Traces of any thing contemporary are, however, rare in the
forty dialogues he printed;—the most important that I have noticed
relating to Charles V. and his retirement at San Yuste, which the good
Bishop seems to have believed was a sincere abandonment of all worldly
thoughts and passions. I find nothing to illustrate the character of
Cortés, except the fact that such meetings were held at his house.</p>

It was long very popular, and there are many editions of it, besides
translations into Italian, German, French, Flemish, and English. One
English version is by Thomas Fortescue, and appeared in 1571. (Warton’s
Eng. Poetry, London, 1824, 8vo, Tom. IV. p. 312.) Another, which is
anonymous, is called “The Treasure of Ancient and Modern Times, etc.,
translated out of that worthy Spanish Gentleman, Pedro Mexia, and Mr.
Francisco Sansovino, the Italian,” etc. (London, 1613, fol.). It is a
curious mixture of similar discussions by different authors, Spanish,
Italian, and French. Mexia’s part begins at Book I. c. 8.</p>

The second dialogue, which is on Inviting to Feasts, is amusing; but
the last, which is on subjects of physical science, such as the causes
of thunder, earthquakes, and comets, is now-a-days only curious or
ridiculous. At the end of the Dialogues, and sometimes at the end
of old editions of the Silva, is found a free translation of the
Exhortation to Virtue by Isocrates, made from the Latin of Agricola,

to discuss such matters except in Latin. (f. 15.) But he replies, like
a true Spaniard, that the Castilian is better for such purposes than
Latin or Greek, and that he trusts before long to see it as widely

He flourished about 1531-45. His “Agonía del Tránsito de la Muerte,”

from his corrected manuscript, many years later. My copy, which seems

treatise called “Diferencias de Libros que ay en el Universo,” by the

in 1539, and printed at Toledo in 1540, 4to. It is written in a good
style, though not without conceits of thought, and conceited phrases.
But it is not, as its title might seem to imply, a criticism on books
and authors, but the opinion of Vanegas himself, how we should study
the great books of God, nature, man, and Christianity. It is, in fact,
intended to discourage the reading of books then much in fashion, and
deemed by him bad.</p>

and 423.) His “Cartas Espirituales” were not printed, I believe, till
the year of his death. (Antonio, Bib. Nova, Tom. I. pp. 639-642.)
His treatises on Self-knowledge, on Prayer, and on other religious

went to Madrid in 1526 with the Cardinal de Grammont, on the subject of
Francis the First’s imprisonment. It is in the rich old French of that
period, and La Fontaine often adopts, with his accustomed skill, its
picturesque phraseology. I suppose this translation is the one cited by
Brunet as made by René Bertaut, of which there were many editions. Mine

and in his “Hist. of the Progress, etc., of the Reformation in Spain”

that the Valdés of the Dialogue had been at Rome; that he was a person
of some authority; and that he had lived long at Naples and in other
parts of Italy. He speaks of Garcilasso de la Vega as if he were alive,
and Garcilasso died in 1536. Llorente, in a passage just cited, calls
Valdés the author of the Diálogo de las Lenguas; and Clemencin—a safer
authority—does the same, once, in the notes to his edition of Don
Quixote, (Tom. IV. p. 285,) though in many other notes he treats it as

Española,” (Madrid, 1737, 2 tom. 12mo); where it fills the first
half of the second volume, and is the best thing in the collection.
Probably the manuscript had been kept out of sight as the work of a
well-known heretic. Mayans says, that it could be traced to Zurita, the
historian, and that, in 1736, it was purchased for the Royal Library,
of which Mayans himself was then librarian. One leaf was wanting, which
he could not supply; and though he seems to have believed Valdés to
have been the author of the Dialogue, he avoids saying so,—perhaps
from an unwillingness to attract the notice of the Inquisition to it.
(Orígenes, Tom. I. pp. 173-180.) Iriarte, in the “Aprobacion” of the
collection, treats the Diálogo as if its author were quite unknown.</p>

<p class="ti1">From the time of Charles V. there seem generally to have
been chroniclers of the kingdom and chroniclers of the personal history

him well, says: “He was a scholar, and I have heard it said he was a
Bachelor of Laws; and when he talked with lawyers and scholars, he
answered in Latin. He was somewhat of a poet, and made couplets in
metre and in prose, [en metro y en prosa,]” etc. It would be amusing
to see poems by Cortés, and especially what the rude old chronicler
calls <i>coplas en prosa</i>; but he knew about as much concerning such
matters as Mons. Jourdain. Cortés, however, was always fond of the
society of cultivated men. In his house at Madrid, (see <i>ante</i>, <a

much employed in affairs of state, and one of the founders of the

Introduction to Lib. XXXIII. he says, “En treinta y quatro años que ha
que estoy en estas partes”;—and in the ninth chapter, which ends Lib.
XXXIV., we have an event recorded with the date of 1548;—so that, for
these three-and-twenty years, he was certainly employed, more or less,
on this great work. But at the end of Book XXXVII. he says, “Y esto
baste quanto a este breve libro del numero treinta y siete, hasta que
el tiempo nos avise de otras cosas que en el se acrescientan”; from
which I infer that he kept each book, or each large division of his
work, open for additions, as long as he lived, and therefore that parts
of it <i>may</i> have been written as late as 1557.</p>

any other similar office in the kingdom, and was held, at different

add the following account of Almagro, one of the early adventurers in
Peru, whom the Pizarros put to death in Cuzco, after they had obtained
uncontrolled power there. “Therefore hear and read all the authors
you may, and compare, one by one, whatever they relate, that all men,
not kings, have freely given away, and you shall surely see how there
is none that can equal Almagro in this matter, and how none can be
compared to him; for kings, indeed, may give and know how to give
whatever pleaseth them, both cities and lands, and lordships, and other
great gifts; but that a man whom yesterday we saw so poor, that all he
possessed was a very small matter, should have a spirit sufficient for
what I have related,—I hold it to be so great a thing, that I know not
the like of it in our own or any other time. For I myself saw, when his
companion, Pizarro, came from Spain, and brought with him that body of
three hundred men to Panamá, that, if Almagro had not received them
and shown them so much free hospitality with so generous a spirit, few
or none of them could have escaped alive; for the land was filled with
disease, and the means of living were so dear, that a bushel of maize
was worth two or three <i>pesos</i>, and an <i>arroba</i> of wine six or seven
gold pieces. To all of them he was a father, and a brother, and a true
friend; for inasmuch as it is pleasant and grateful to some men to make
gain, and to heap up and to gather together moneys and estates, even
so much and more pleasant was it to him to share with others and to
give away; so that the day when he gave nothing, he accounted it for
a day lost. And in his very face you might see the pleasure and true
delight he felt when he found occasion to help him who had need. And
since, after so long a fellowship and friendship as there was between
these two great leaders, from the days when their companions were few
and their means small, till they saw themselves full of wealth and
strength, there hath at last come forth so much discord, scandal, and
death, well must it appear matter of wonder even to those who shall but
hear of it, and much more to us, who knew them in their low estate, and
have no less borne witness to their greatness and prosperity.” (General
y Natural Historia de las Indias, Lib. XLVII., MS.) Much of it is,
like the preceding passage, in the true, old, rambling, moralizing,
chronicling vein.</p>

href="#FNanchor_911">[911]</a></span> There is a valuable life of Las
Casas in Quintana, “Vidas de Españoles Célebres” (Madrid, 1833, 12mo,
Tom. III. pp. 255-510). The seventh article in the Appendix, concerning
the connection of Las Casas with the slave-trade, will be read with
particular interest; because, by materials drawn from unpublished
documents of unquestionable authenticity, it makes it certain, that,
although at one time Las Casas favored what had been begun earlier,—the
transportation of negroes to the West Indies, in order to relieve the
Indians,—as other good men in his time favored it, he did so under the
impression, that, according to the law of nations, the negroes thus
brought to America were both rightful captives taken by the Portuguese
in war and rightful slaves. But afterwards he changed his mind on the
subject. He declared “the captivity of the negroes to be as unjust as
that of the Indians,”—“ser tan injusto el cautiverio de los negros
como el de los Indios,”—and even expressed a fear, that, though he had
fallen into the error of favoring the importation of black slaves into
America from ignorance and good-will, he might, after all, fail to
stand excused for it before the Divine Justice. Quintana, Tom. III. p.
471.</p>

<p id="Footnote_913"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_913">[913]</a></span> Quintana (p. 413, note) doubts
<i>when</i> this famous treatise was written; but Las Casas himself says,
in the opening of his “Brevísima Relacion,” that it was written in
1542.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_914"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_914">[914]</a></span> This important tract continued
long to be printed separately, both at home and abroad. I use a copy
of it in double columns, Spanish and Italian, Venice, 1643, 12mo; but,
like the rest, the Brevísima Relacion may be consulted in an edition of
the Works of Las Casas by Llorente, which appeared at Paris in 1822, in
2 vols. 8vo, in the original Spanish, almost at the same time with his
translation of them into French. It should be noticed, perhaps, that
Llorente’s version is not always strict, and that the two new treatises
he imputes to Las Casas, as well as the one on the Authority of Kings,
are not absolutely proved to be his.</p>

<p class="ti1">The translation referred to above appeared, in fact,
the same year, and at the end of it an “Apologie de Las Casas,” by
Grégoire, with letters of Funes and Mier, and notes of Llorente to
sustain it,—all to defend Las Casas on the subject of the slave-trade;
but Quintana, as we have seen, has gone to the original documents,
and leaves no doubt, both that Las Casas once favored it, and that he
altered his mind afterwards.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_915"><span class="label"><a

Cortés con otras cosas cerca dello, despues de Marques, en la villa
de Monçon, estando alli celebrando cortes el Emperador, año de mil
y quinientos y quarenta y dos, riendo y mofando con estas formales
palabras, a la mi fé andubé por alli como un gentil cosario.” (Historia
General de las Indias, Lib. III. c. 115, MS.) It may be worth noting,
that 1542, the year when Cortés made this scandalous speech, was the
year in which Las Casas wrote his Brevísima Relacion.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
